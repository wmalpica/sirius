 * routes local paths to @c kvikio_context. Reads go through
 * @c sirius_datasource either way; the kvikio backend drives
 * @c kvikio::FileHandle directly. Multi-GPU forces @ref io_backend::sirius.
 *
 * @c cache is the read path's whole caching configuration, and its only home;
 * @ref apply_cache_mode derives @c uring.use_odirect and
 * @c cache.dispose_on_idle from it, so neither is settable on its own.
 *
 * Sub-configs:
 *  - @c uring   — uring reactor tunables (local-disk IO path).
 *  - @c rest    — REST reactor tunables (S3/object-store IO path).
 *  - @c kvikio  — kvikIO backend tunables (local-file fallback path).
 *  - @c cache   — caching mode, eviction policy and prefetching-cache tunables.
 *  - @c object_store — object-store credentials and endpoint.
