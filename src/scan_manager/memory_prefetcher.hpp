/**
 * @brief Background host->GPU memory prefetcher for queued pinned-cache scan splits.
 *
 * Host-pinned scans put all their splits (per-query wrapper data_batches over
 * host slices of the pinned chunks) onto their split_connectors at query start,
 * but the H2D copy for each batch happens only when the scan's pipeline task
 * executes (scan_operator_input::prepare_for_processing). Because scan tasks
 * are created strictly on topology demand, the copy engines sit idle during
 * compute-bound phases and then the next scan's H2D burst runs with idle SMs.
 *
 * The prefetcher overlaps the two: worker threads walk the connectors in scan
 * execution order (the scan manager passes them ordered by @c _scan_op_order,
 * the same order the task creator drains them) and convert pending resident
 * batches to GPU tier early, gated on GPU memory headroom. When the scan task
 * later runs, prepare_for_processing sees the batch already GPU-resident and
 * skips the upload (and the task creator's cached-scan locality derivation
 * reads the batch's post-conversion space, so device dispatch stays
 * consistent).
 *
 * Why worker threads (rather than one async stream of copies): a conversion is
 * not a bare cudaMemcpyAsync — convert_to allocates the device table,
 * reconstructs the cudf table from the host layout, and synchronizes its
 * stream before the batch's exclusive lock can be released, so each in-flight
 * conversion needs a thread to drive it. Concurrency across batches therefore
 * scales with num_threads. Each worker's private CUDA stream carries no copy
 * traffic (the converter allocates and copies on a pool stream it acquires
 * internally); it exists only as a stable per-worker key for attaching the
 * admission reservation to the allocation tracker.
 *
 * Races with a consumer are arbitrated by the data_batch state machine: the
 * conversion holds the exclusive (mutable) lock via try_to_mutable (skip on
 * contention), and prepare_for_processing re-checks the tier under its own
 * lock.
 *
 * Memory safety: converted batches live in connector queues, which the
 * downgrade executor does NOT scan (it walks data repositories), so
 * prefetched-but-unconsumed bytes cannot be reclaimed under pressure.
 * Admission must therefore reserve BEFORE gating: the worker reserves the
 * conversion peak (charging availability immediately) and only then checks
 * the min_free_fraction floor, so the check sees every concurrent worker's
 * in-flight admission and the floor holds regardless of num_threads. The
 * reservation is then attached to the worker thread's allocation tracker so
 * the conversion's allocations draw it down instead of being counted a
 * second time on top of it.
