 * @brief Manages the creation and scheduling of GPU pipeline tasks.

 * The task_creator is responsible for creating tasks from GPU pipelines and scheduling

 * from the task_creation_queue. The creator prioritizes table scan pipelines and uses
 * hints from operators to determine the next tasks to create.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   1. Construct with a task_creation_queue, thread count, and pipeline map.
 *   2. Call start_thread_pool() to begin processing tasks.
 *   3. Call start() to schedule initial scan pipelines.
 *   4. Call stop_thread_pool() when done.
