/**
 * @brief Owns one `cucascade::shared_data_repository_manager` per in-flight query.
 *
 * Replaces the single SiriusContext-wide manager. Operator ids restart at 0 for every query
 * (see `pipeline::assign_operator_ids`), so the `{operator_id, port_id}` repository keys are
 * only unique *within* a query — each query therefore needs its own manager. Ending a query
 * drops only that query's repositories instead of wiping every in-flight query's data.
 *
 * Managers are handed out as `shared_ptr` rather than references: a downgrade worker may be
 * sweeping a manager while its query ends, and shared ownership means the manager object
 * survives until the last borrower releases it instead of dangling. The manager alone does
 * not protect its repositories: spill callers must also hold the victim's lifecycle work lease.
 *
 * Thread-safe. `get_all()` returns a snapshot built under the lock so callers can iterate
 * without holding it — memory-pressure sweeps are long and blocking, and holding this mutex
 * across one would serialize query begin/end behind spilling.
