"""Split a log file into analytical-SQL query segments.

A "query" runs from a `[host_pool] HOST:<id> QueryBegin` line to the
matching `[host_pool] HOST:<id> QueryEnd` line. The SQL text is emitted on a
separate line as `QueryBegin: SQL: <sql>`; we keep only queries whose SQL
(case-insensitive) starts with `select ` or `with `.

If a QueryBegin has no QueryEnd (log truncated, crash), the segment is still
returned with status="incomplete" so downstream can analyze what was captured.
