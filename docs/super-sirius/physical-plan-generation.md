# Physical Plan Generation

This document covers three interconnected topics: translating DuckDB logical plans to Sirius physical operators (including the GPU pipeline operators inserted at plan time), constructing pipelines, and the pipeline shapes that result for distributed GPU execution.

## Part 1: Plan Generator

**File:** `src/planner/sirius_physical_plan_generator.cpp`

The `sirius_physical_plan_generator::create_plan()` method is the entry point. It:

1. Resolves types for each logical operator
2. Resolves column references via `ColumnBindingResolver`
3. Dispatches to operator-specific `create_plan()` overloads via a switch on `op.type`
4. Returns a `sirius_physical_operator` tree

### Operator Mapping Table

| DuckDB Logical Operator | Sirius Physical Operator | Plan Builder File |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
| `LOGICAL_GET` | `TABLE_SCAN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_get.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_PROJECTION` | `PROJECTION` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_projection.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_FILTER` | `FILTER` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_filter.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_AGGREGATE_AND_GROUP_BY` | `HASH_GROUP_BY` / `UNGROUPED_AGGREGATE` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_aggregate.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_COMPARISON_JOIN` | `HASH_JOIN` / `NESTED_LOOP_JOIN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_comparison_join.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_DELIM_JOIN` | `LEFT_DELIM_JOIN` / `RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_comparison_join.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_ORDER_BY` | `ORDER_BY` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_order.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_TOP_N` | `TOP_N` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_top_n.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_LIMIT` | `STREAMING_LIMIT` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_limit.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_CHUNK_GET` | `COLUMN_DATA_SCAN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_column_data_get.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_DELIM_GET` | `DELIM_SCAN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_delim_get.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_EXPRESSION_GET` | `COLUMN_DATA_SCAN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_expression_get.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_MATERIALIZED_CTE` | `CTE` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_cte.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_CTE_REF` | `CTE_SCAN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_recursive_cte.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_DUMMY_SCAN` | `DUMMY_SCAN` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_dummy_scan.cpp` |
| `LOGICAL_EMPTY_RESULT` | `EMPTY_RESULT` | `src/planner/sirius_plan_empty_result.cpp` |

**Unsupported operators** (throw `NotImplementedException`, triggering CPU fallback):
`LOGICAL_WINDOW`, `LOGICAL_UNNEST`, `LOGICAL_SAMPLE`, `LOGICAL_ANY_JOIN`, `LOGICAL_ASOF_JOIN`, `LOGICAL_CROSS_PRODUCT`, `LOGICAL_RECURSIVE_CTE`

### Join Planning

**File:** `src/planner/sirius_plan_comparison_join.cpp`

The `plan_comparison_join()` method selects the join implementation:

1. **Hash Join** — chosen when at least one equality condition exists. Checks `are_conditions_supported()` for mixed joins (equality + inequality on disjoint columns). Created with `max_build_hash_table_bytes` limit.
2. **Nested Loop Join** — fallback for pure inequality joins where `PhysicalNestedLoopJoin::IsSupported()` returns true.

Left side = probe (streamed), right side = build (materialized).

### Aggregate Planning

**File:** `src/planner/sirius_plan_aggregate.cpp`

- **Ungrouped aggregate** — when no GROUP BY columns exist
- **Grouped aggregate** — hash-based GROUP BY using cuDF's `groupby()` API
- **AVG decomposition** — AVG is split into SUM + COUNT_VALID (cuDF doesn't support AVG directly)
- **COUNT(DISTINCT)** — implemented via `COLLECT_SET` aggregation, then counting unique rows
- **HUGEINT downcast** — HUGEINT types are downcast to BIGINT (cuDF doesn't support int128)

### Filter Pushdown

**File:** `src/planner/sirius_plan_get.cpp`

When a `LogicalGet` has table filters and the table function supports `FILTER_PUSHDOWN`:
- Filters are pushed into the `sirius_physical_table_scan` operator
- Filter columns are added to `projection_ids` even if not in the output
- A separate `sirius_physical_filter` is created for column types not supported by the table function

### Projection Elision

**File:** `src/planner/sirius_plan_projection.cpp`

Projections are omitted when columns are already in the correct order (passthrough case like `PROJECTION(#0, #1, #2, ...)`).

### Projection Folding

After the operator tree is built, `create_plan()` runs `fold_adjacent_projections()` over the whole plan as a final pass. Sirius routes every planner-created projection through `push_projection()`, which both elides identity passthrough projections and, when its child is already a projection, composes the two select lists into one. The standalone `fold_adjacent_projections()` post-pass then collapses any remaining `PROJECTION → PROJECTION` stacks anywhere in the tree — including projection pairs that arise from separate plan-builder steps (filter `projection_map` reordering, aggregate child/filter hoisting, table-scan unsupported-filter projections, and the user's `SELECT` list) and projections sitting under other operators such as joins.

Composition substitutes each outer select-list reference (`#i`) with a clone of the inner projection's `select_list[i]`. Folding is refused when either select list has a null slot (an unsupported-expression fallback) or when a non-trivial inner expression would be duplicated across multiple outer reference sites; only immediate parent/child projection pairs are candidates, never folds across non-projection operators. The result is a single GPU expression-evaluation stage where multiple stacked projections would otherwise each run `expression_evaluator` over every batch.

## Part 2: Pipeline Structure

### `sirius_pipeline`

**File:** `src/include/pipeline/sirius_pipeline.hpp`

A pipeline is an ordered list of operators:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `source` | `optional_ptr<sirius_physical_operator>` | Alias for the **first** operator in `operators` |
| `operators` | `vector<reference<sirius_physical_operator>>` | **All** operators in execution order, including source and sink |
| `sink` | `optional_ptr<sirius_physical_operator>` | Alias for the **last** operator in `operators` |
| `dependencies` | `vector<shared_ptr<sirius_pipeline>>` | Pipelines that must finish before this one starts |
| `parents` | `vector<weak_ptr<sirius_pipeline>>` | Pipelines that depend on this one finishing |
| `tasks_created` | `atomic<size_t>` | Number of tasks created for this pipeline |
| `tasks_completed` | `atomic<size_t>` | Number of tasks that have finished |
| `pipeline_finished` | `atomic<bool>` | Set when all tasks are done and source is drained |

> **Important:** Unlike DuckDB's pipeline model where `source` and `sink` are separate from the `operators` list, Sirius finalizes pipelines at the end of `initialize_internal()` (line ~1133) by pushing the sink into `operators` and setting `source = &operators[0]`. After finalization, `operators` contains **every** operator from source to sink inclusive. `get_operators()` returns this full list, which `compute_task()` iterates over to call each operator's `execute()`.

Key methods:
- `mark_task_created()` — increments `tasks_created`, starts NVTX range on first task
- `mark_task_completed()` — increments `tasks_completed`, calls `update_pipeline_status()`
- `update_pipeline_status()` — checks completion: a pipeline finishes when any of its operators has exhausted a limit, or when its first node reports `is_source_pipeline_finished()` and `all_ports_empty()`, and `tasks_created == tasks_completed`. Source-specific completion (a drained DuckDB source vs. a closed/drained scan `split_connector`) is encapsulated behind the operator's `is_source_pipeline_finished()` rather than a per-operator-type switch.
- `is_ready()` — marks pipeline ready and reverses operators to execution order
- `register_new_batch_index()` / `update_batch_index()` — batch ordering for order-preserving execution

### `sirius_meta_pipeline`

**File:** `src/include/pipeline/sirius_meta_pipeline.hpp`

Groups pipelines that share the same sink operator. Manages inter-pipeline dependencies and build order.

Key methods:
- `build(operator)` — delegates to `operator.build_pipelines()` on the base pipeline
- `ready()` — calls `is_ready()` on all pipelines recursively
- `create_child_meta_pipeline(current, op)` — creates a child for blocking operator build inputs
- `create_pipeline()` — adds a new pipeline sharing the same sink
- `add_dependencies_from(dependent, start, including)` — collects pipelines after a point as dependencies

Build order rules:
1. Join build side before probe side
2. Child meta-pipelines after all pipelines for the current operator
3. Child pipeline auto-depends on current streaming pipeline and all siblings

### `sirius_pipeline_build_state`

**File:** `src/include/pipeline/sirius_pipeline_build_state.hpp`

Provides controlled write access to pipeline internals during construction:
- `set_pipeline_source()` / `set_pipeline_sink()` — assign source/sink operators
- `add_pipeline_operator()` — add intermediate operator
- `create_child_pipeline()` — delegate to engine
- `delim_join_dependencies` — maps scan operators to their delim join producer pipelines
- `cte_dependencies` — maps CTE scan operators to their materialization pipelines

### `build_pipelines()` Patterns

Each operator implements `build_pipelines(current, meta_pipeline)`. Note that during this phase, operators are added in DuckDB's style (separate source/operators/sink). The finalization step at the end of `initialize_internal()` then merges them into a single `operators` list (see [Pipeline Finalization](#pipeline-finalization) below).

**Streaming operators** (FILTER, PROJECTION, LIMIT):
```
state.add_pipeline_operator(current, *this);
children[0]->build_pipelines(current, meta_pipeline);
```

**Blocking operators** (HASH_JOIN):
```
state.add_pipeline_operator(current, *this);
// Create child meta-pipeline for build side
auto& child = meta_pipeline.create_child_meta_pipeline(current, *this);
child.build(*children[1]);  // Build RHS first
children[0]->build_pipelines(current, meta_pipeline);  // Probe in current
```

**Source operators** (scans):
```
state.set_pipeline_source(current, *this);
```

**CTE operator**:
```
auto& child = meta_pipeline.create_child_meta_pipeline(current, *this);
child.build(*children[0]);  // Materialization pipeline
// Register CTE scan dependencies
for (auto& scan : cte_scans) {
    state.cte_dependencies[scan] = child.get_base_pipeline();
}
children[1]->build_pipelines(current, meta_pipeline);  // Reference side
```

### Pipeline Finalization

Pipelines reach their final shape during construction: `create_pipeline()` pre-populates `operators` with the meta-pipeline's sink, per-operator `build_pipelines` appends intermediates and sources as it recurses, and `sirius_pipeline::is_ready()` reverses the list and derives `source`/`sink` from it.

After `is_ready()`:
- `operators` contains **all** operators from source to sink inclusive
- `source` points to `operators[0]` (the first operator)
- `sink` points to `operators.back()`
- `get_operators()` returns this full list

`finalize_pipeline_structure()` in `sirius_pipeline_converter` then populates each pipeline's `dependencies` from the wiring-derived parents, inserting a join's build-side CONCAT producer at slot 0 — `link_join_partition_siblings()` and `reorder_pipelines_topologically()` read the slots positionally.

## Part 3: Pipeline Shapes

The plan generator inserts every GPU pipeline operator into the plan tree (Part 1), so `sirius_pipeline_converter::convert()` (`src/pipeline/sirius_pipeline_converter.cpp`) is a pure topology pass over the meta-pipeline tree:

1. `schedule_pipelines()` — walk the meta-pipeline tree and schedule pipelines in dependency order
2. `compute_repository_wiring()` — emit sink→consumer wiring descriptors via tree-parent lookup; `resolve_port_id()` / `resolve_barrier()` pick each edge's port and barrier semantics
3. `setup_pipeline_parents()` — derive parent pipeline edges from the wiring descriptors
4. `finalize_pipeline_structure()` — populate `dependencies`, build-side-first for joins (see [Pipeline Finalization](#pipeline-finalization))
5. `link_join_partition_siblings()` — link PARTITION/JOIN/CONCAT sibling chains
6. `configure_partition_min_partitions()` — apply the multi-GPU partition floor
7. `reorder_pipelines_topologically()` — permute the schedule into a strict leaf-first topological order (every pipeline after its producers) and renumber pipeline IDs to match; join dependencies stay build-side-first so a join publishes its dynamic filters before the probe-side scans they prune are launched

`sirius_engine::initialize_internal()` is a thin orchestrator calling `sirius_pipeline_converter(build_ctx, op_params).convert(*root_pipeline)` and materializing the wiring descriptors into runtime repositories and ports.

The plan-time wraps introduce new operators and **data repositories between pipelines**. Repositories are never placed in the middle of a pipeline — they always connect the sink of one pipeline to the source of the next.

In the diagrams below, `[A, B, C]` denotes a pipeline where A is `operators[0]` (source), C is `operators.back()` (sink), and B is intermediate. After finalization, each operator appears **exactly once** in its pipeline's `operators` list. Solid edges denote data repositories connecting pipelines, labeled with the barrier type (e.g., `FULL`, `PARTIAL`, `PIPELINE`). Dashed edges indicate internal pushes within an operator's `sink()` method.

### TABLE_SCAN Rewrite

During plan generation, a `TABLE_SCAN` whose source is a supported format is rewritten in place into a single `GPU_SCAN` operator (`sirius_gpu_scan_operator`) that inherits the TABLE_SCAN's tree position and stays the source-leaf of the same pipeline — no separate scan pipeline is created. `GPU_SCAN` is format-agnostic: it owns a pluggable `io::gpu_ingestible` that knows how to enumerate splits and materialize each split into a `cudf::table`. `wrap_table_scan_source()` (`src/planner/sirius_physical_plan_generator.cpp`) dispatches on the bound table function name:

**Parquet (`parquet_scan` / `read_parquet` / `sirius_read_parquet`, including `s3://` paths):** `build_parquet_table_info()` captures the DuckDB bind data (resolved file paths, hive-partition indices, returned/column/projection ids, table filters) into a `parquet_ingestible_table_info`, builds a parquet ingestible via `make_ingestible()`, and constructs the `GPU_SCAN` operator around it.

**DuckDB-native (`seq_scan` against an attached `.duckdb` file):** `build_duckdb_native_table_info()` resolves the `DuckTableEntry`, fills a `duckdb_native_ingestible_table_info` (storage handle, client context, qualified table identity for the pin cache, projected columns/types, table filters), builds a duckdb-native ingestible via `make_ingestible()`, and constructs the `GPU_SCAN` operator around it.

Any other scan function falls back to CPU: `create_plan(LogicalGet&)` declines it before plan generation reaches the wrap.

During `prepare_for_query`, `sirius_scan_manager` takes the ingestible off each `GPU_SCAN` operator, peeks its file paths for a pinned-cache match (substituting a cached ingestible on a hit), and binds a `split_connector` to the operator. The operator pulls splits from the connector inside `get_next_task_input_data()` (see [Scan — Scan Manager](scan.md#scan-manager)).

### HASH_JOIN Probe Side

When HASH_JOIN appears as an intermediate operator, a PARTITION and CONCAT are inserted before it, each in its own pipeline:

**Before:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    P["[scan, filter, HASH_JOIN, projection, ..., sink]"]
```

**After (join is NOT the first intermediate operator):**
```mermaid
graph LR
    P1["Pipeline 1<br/>[scan, ..., op_before_join]"] -->|"FULL"| PP["Partition Pipeline<br/>[PARTITION]"]
    PP -->|"PARTIAL"| CP["Concat Pipeline<br/>[CONCAT]"]
    CP -->|"FULL"| MP["Main Pipeline<br/>[HASH_JOIN, projection, ..., sink]"]
```

**After (join IS the first intermediate operator):**
```mermaid
graph LR
    PP["Partition Pipeline<br/>[PARTITION]"] -->|"PARTIAL"| CP["Concat Pipeline<br/>[CONCAT]"]
    CP -->|"FULL"| MP["Main Pipeline<br/>[HASH_JOIN, projection, ..., sink]"]
```

- When the join is not the first intermediate operator, Pipeline 1 is created with all operators before the join; the last one becomes the sink (acts as a pipeline breaker so PARTITION can see total input size). The repository from Pipeline 1 to Partition Pipeline uses `FULL` barrier (intermediate operator as sink — default)
- When the join IS the first intermediate operator (`join_pos == 0`), the partition pipeline starts from the current source directly (no Pipeline 1)
- PARTITION and CONCAT are each in their own single-operator pipeline
- The repository from PARTITION uses `PARTIAL` barrier (since the downstream is CONCAT — line 1014)
- The repository from CONCAT to the main pipeline uses `FULL` barrier (default)

For multiple joins in the same pipeline, the pattern repeats — each join gets its own PARTITION → CONCAT pair, with subsequent ones using the previous CONCAT as their starting point.

### HASH_JOIN Build Side

When HASH_JOIN is the sink of a pipeline (build side), the same PARTITION → CONCAT pattern is applied. There is always a pipeline breaker before PARTITION so that the total input size is known for determining partition count:

**Before:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    P["[scan, op1, ..., opN, HASH_JOIN(sink)]"]
```

**After:**
```mermaid
graph LR
    P1["Pipeline 1<br/>[scan, ..., opN]"] -->|"FULL"| PP["Partition Pipeline<br/>[PARTITION]"]
    PP -->|"PARTIAL"| CP["Concat Pipeline<br/>[CONCAT]"]
    CP -->|"FULL, 'build'"| JP["Pipeline with HASH_JOIN"]
```

- Pipeline 1's sink is the last intermediate operator before HASH_JOIN (pipeline breaker); it connects to the Partition Pipeline with `FULL` barrier (default)
- PARTITION → CONCAT uses `PARTIAL` barrier (downstream is CONCAT — line 1014)
- Build-side CONCAT pushes to the HASH_JOIN's `"build"` port with `FULL` barrier (default)
- The probe and build PARTITION operators are linked as siblings for partition count coordination

For a dynamic-filter-producing `BUILD_PROBE` join, the build CONCAT switches to `concat_all` and
its synchronous `"build"`-port push completes filter construction, multi-GPU replication, and
channel publication before downstream task creation follows that join into its **immediate** probe
producer. This edge ordering does not gate a base scan reached transitively through an intervening
join; such a scan samples the channel opportunistically under normal scheduler order. See
[Immediate-probe ordering](dynamic-filters.md#immediate-probe-ordering) and
[Transitive scan targets and publication timing](dynamic-filters.md#transitive-scan-targets-and-publication-timing).

### ORDER_BY → 3-Phase Sort

```mermaid
graph LR
    P1["Pipeline 1<br/>[scan, ..., ORDER_BY]"] -->|"PIPELINE"| P2["Pipeline 2<br/>[SORT_SAMPLE, SORT_PARTITION]"]
    P2 -->|"FULL"| P3["Pipeline 3<br/>[MERGE_SORT]"]
    P3 -->|"FULL"| DS["downstream"]
```

1. **Pipeline 1**: Current pipeline keeps ORDER_BY as sink (local sort per batch)
2. **Pipeline 2**: SORT_SAMPLE and SORT_PARTITION run back-to-back in the same `gpu_pipeline_task`. `PIPELINE` barrier from Pipeline 1 — batches arrive as produced; SORT_SAMPLE overrides `get_next_task_hint()` to wait for N samples before computing boundaries; SORT_PARTITION reads boundaries directly from SORT_SAMPLE via `_sample_op`
3. **Pipeline 3**: MERGE_SORT. `FULL` barrier — must wait for all partitions. Downstream pipelines that previously used ORDER_BY as source are updated to use MERGE_SORT

### HASH_GROUP_BY

```mermaid
graph LR
    P1["Pipeline 1<br/>[scan, ..., HASH_GROUP_BY]"] -->|"FULL"| P2["Pipeline 2<br/>[PARTITION]"]
    P2 -->|"FULL"| P3["Pipeline 3<br/>[MERGE_GROUP_BY]"]
    P3 -->|"FULL"| DS["downstream"]
```

1. **Pipeline 1**: Current pipeline keeps HASH_GROUP_BY as sink (partial aggregation per batch). `FULL` barrier (HASH_GROUP_BY falls to default wiring)
2. **Pipeline 2**: PARTITION. Repository to MERGE_GROUP_BY uses `FULL` barrier (downstream is not CONCAT — `PARTIAL` is only used when PARTITION feeds directly into CONCAT)
3. **Pipeline 3**: MERGE_GROUP_BY. Downstream pipelines updated to use MERGE_GROUP_BY as source

### UNGROUPED_AGGREGATE

```mermaid
graph LR
    P1["Pipeline 1<br/>[scan, ..., UNGROUPED_AGGREGATE]"] -->|"FULL"| P2["Pipeline 2<br/>[MERGE_AGGREGATE]"]
    P2 -->|"FULL"| DS["downstream"]
```

No PARTITION needed. MERGE_AGGREGATE collects partial aggregates from Pipeline 1.

### TOP_N

```mermaid
graph LR
    P1["Pipeline 1<br/>[scan, ..., TOP_N]"] -->|"FULL"| P2["Pipeline 2<br/>[MERGE_TOP_N]"]
    P2 -->|"FULL"| DS["downstream"]
```

MERGE_TOP_N merges local top-N results.

### DELIM_JOIN

Complex splitting for correlated subqueries. Both LEFT and RIGHT variants contain two internal operators:
- `join` — the actual HASH_JOIN (one child replaced with a scan of cached data)
- `distinct_root` — the `MERGE_GROUP_BY → PARTITION_DISTINCT → DISTINCT` chain (the bottom DISTINCT, borrowed via the non-owning `distinct` pointer, is a HASH_GROUP_BY that produces deduplicated data for the DELIM_SCAN operators in the correlated subquery)

The delim join is a **fan-out sink**: its base `sink()` pushes each input batch to two framework-scheduled branch pipelines — the DISTINCT branch and the join-feeding branch (`partition_join` for RIGHT, `column_data_scan` for LEFT). These sub-operators are first-class pipelines (not driven inline), so the delim join carries its own two `next_port_after_sink` edges and is wired through the uniform tree-parent path like any other sink. The internal HASH_JOIN undergoes standard probe-side and build-side splitting (documented in the [HASH_JOIN](#hash_join-probe-side) sections above).

#### RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN

In the constructor, RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN extracts the RHS child from the internal join and replaces it with a `dummy_scan` placeholder. The extracted RHS becomes `children[0]` of the delim join, built via a child meta-pipeline. `wrap_join` wraps the internal join's build side with `CONCAT_build → PARTITION_build → DUMMY_SCAN`; the `partition_join` pointer is set to that PARTITION_build, which becomes a framework-scheduled single-op pipeline fed by the delim join's fan-out.

When `operators.size() > 0` (intermediate operators before the delim join), a pipeline breaker is inserted:

```mermaid
graph LR
    PP["Pipeline Pre<br/>[source, ..., last_op]"] -->|"FULL"| PD["Pipeline Delim<br/>[RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN]"]
    PD -.->|"FULL (partition_join)"| CP["Concat Pipeline<br/>[CONCAT]"]
    PD -.->|"FULL (distinct)"| PDP["PD Pipeline<br/>[PARTITION]"]
    CP -->|"FULL, 'build'"| PR["Probe Pipeline<br/>(at internal HASH_JOIN)"]
    PDP -->|"FULL"| MR["Merge Pipeline<br/>[MERGE_GROUP_BY]"]
    MR -->|"FULL"| DS["Downstream<br/>(DELIM_SCAN pipelines)"]
```

Edges from the delim join to `partition_join` and `distinct` are its fan-out sink's two `next_port_after_sink` outputs; each sub-operator runs as its own framework-scheduled pipeline.

When `operators.size() == 0` (no intermediate operators), no pipeline breaker is needed — the current pipeline keeps RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN as its sink directly.

- The CONCAT is a build concat (`is_build=true`); it connects to the internal HASH_JOIN's `"build"` port
- `partition_join` (PARTITION_build) is a single-op pipeline fed by the delim join's fan-out; its output feeds CONCAT_build
- The probe and build partitions are linked as siblings for partition-count coordination; the RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN inner join is detected via its tree parent (`link_join_partition_siblings`) so the build (distinct) side drives the count

#### LEFT_DELIM_JOIN

In the constructor, LEFT_DELIM_JOIN extracts the LHS child from the internal join and replaces it with a `column_data_scan`. The extracted LHS becomes `children[0]`, built via a child meta-pipeline. Unlike RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN, **no pipeline breaker** is created and **no partition_join/concat pair** is needed — the `column_data_scan` directly feeds downstream pipelines.

```mermaid
graph LR
    PM["Pipeline Main<br/>[source, ..., LEFT_DELIM_JOIN]"] -.->|"FULL (column_data_scan)"| DW["Downstream<br/>(probe pipeline reads cached LHS data)"]
    PM -.->|"FULL (distinct)"| PDP["PD Pipeline<br/>[PARTITION]"]
    PDP -->|"FULL"| MR["Merge Pipeline<br/>[MERGE_GROUP_BY]"]
    MR -->|"FULL"| DS["Downstream<br/>(DELIM_SCAN pipelines)"]
```

Edges from the delim join to `column_data_scan` and `distinct` are its fan-out sink's two `next_port_after_sink` outputs; each runs as its own framework-scheduled pipeline.

- `column_data_scan` caches the input data so the internal HASH_JOIN's probe side can scan it
- The internal HASH_JOIN is built into the probe pipeline via `join->build_pipelines()`, so its build side (the correlated subquery) gets a normal child meta-pipeline with standard HASH_JOIN handling
- `build_join_pipelines` adds the internal HASH_JOIN as an operator in the probe pipeline, with `column_data_scan` as its source: `[column_data_scan, HASH_JOIN, ..., outer_sink]`

#### Key Differences

| Aspect | RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN | LEFT_DELIM_JOIN |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Side eliminated | RHS | LHS |
| Internal join child replaced | RHS → `dummy_scan` | LHS → `column_data_scan` |
| Pipeline breaker | Yes (if intermediate ops exist) | Never |
| Build-side data path | `partition_join` → CONCAT → HASH_JOIN "build" port | Standard HASH_JOIN build handling (correlated subquery) |
| Inner-join build subtree | CONCAT_build → PARTITION_build (`partition_join`) → DUMMY_SCAN placeholder; `partition_join` is a framework-scheduled pipeline fed by the fan-out | Real correlated-subquery subtree under CONCAT_build |
| Cached data scan | N/A | `column_data_scan` feeds probe side |

## Part 4: Port Wiring

### `insert_repository()`

**File:** `src/sirius_engine.cpp`

Two overloads handle repository creation:

1. **Between two operators in different pipelines**: Creates a `shared_data_repository` keyed by `(operator_id, port_id)`, connects it to the port, and adds the pipeline dependency.
2. **Between a partition and its consumer**: Creates a partitioned repository with the appropriate barrier type.

### Barrier Types

| Type | Semantics | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `FULL` | Downstream waits for all upstream data before starting | Hash join build side |
| `PARTIAL` | Downstream can consume data incrementally as it arrives | CONCAT after PARTITION (streaming joins) |
| `PIPELINE` | No synchronization — data flows immediately | Within a single pipeline |

The barrier type is set during `insert_repository()` and checked by the base `get_next_task_hint()` method to determine operator readiness.

### Port Structure

```cpp
struct port {
    MemoryBarrierType type;
    cucascade::shared_data_repository* repo;
    shared_ptr<sirius_pipeline> src_pipeline;
    shared_ptr<sirius_pipeline> dest_pipeline;
};
```

Operators access their ports by name:
- `"default"` — primary input (most operators)
- `"build"` — build-side input (hash join)
