# Task Creator

This document covers the task creation subsystem: how the system decides when and what tasks to create based on operator readiness and data availability.

## Overview

**File:** `src/creator/task_creator.hpp`, `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`

The `task_creator` is a multi-threaded component that converts operator scheduling requests into concrete scan or GPU pipeline tasks. It maintains global state maps for each operator type and uses a hint-chain recursion to find the deepest ready operator.

Task creation policy is internal and currently demand-driven, with source-side
pipelines prioritized first within each branch. The engine retains its
lookahead and reverse-priority primitives for policy-controlled use, but users
do not select either through YAML.

## Core Flow

```
schedule(operator*)
    ↓
_task_creation_queue.push(request)
    ↓
manager_loop() picks up request
    ↓
get_operator_for_next_task(operator) — follows hint chain
    ↓
operator->get_next_task_hint() → READY or WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA
    ↓
Create task (gpu_pipeline_task)
    ↓
Dispatch to executor (task_scheduler)
```

## Per-query State

Created for each query at execution-window begin, filled during `prepare_for_query()`, and removed by `reset(query_id)`:

| Map | Key | Value | Purpose |
|-----|-----|-------|---------|
| `_query_task_global_states` | query ID | `query_task_global_state` | Completion handler, per-operator pipeline states, and look-ahead queue for one query |

The registry is protected by `_global_state_mutex`. Each query's pipeline-state map is filled before its task-creation workers read it.

## `TaskCreationHint` Enum

**File:** `src/op/sirius_physical_operator.hpp`

```cpp
enum class TaskCreationHint { WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA, READY };

struct task_creation_hint {
    TaskCreationHint hint{TaskCreationHint::WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA};
    sirius_physical_operator* producer{nullptr};
};
```

- `READY` — operator has sufficient input data, create a task now
- `WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA` — follow `producer` pointer to find upstream operator

## `get_operator_for_next_task()` — Recursive Hint Chain

**File:** `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`

```
function get_operator_for_next_task(node):
    hint = node->get_next_task_hint()
    if hint is READY:
        return hint.producer  // create task from this operator
    if hint is WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA:
        producer = hint.producer
        return get_operator_for_next_task(producer)  // recurse upstream
    if no hint:
        return nullptr  // nothing to do
```

This recursion ensures data flows from the deepest producers first, respecting pipeline dependencies.

## Base Class `get_next_task_hint()`

**File:** `src/op/sirius_physical_operator.cpp`

Default implementation checks all input ports in order:

1. If any `FULL` barrier port's source pipeline is not finished → return `WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA` pointing to that pipeline's source
2. If all ports have data available (and FULL barriers have finished source pipelines) → return `READY`
3. If any `PARTIAL` barrier port's source pipeline is not finished → return `WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA`
4. Otherwise → return `nullopt` (nothing to do)

## Base Class `get_next_task_input_data()`

**File:** `src/op/sirius_physical_operator.cpp`

Default implementation pops one batch from each input port:

```
for each port (in order):
    batch = port.repo->pop_data_batch(state=task_created)
    batches.push_back(batch)
return operator_data(batches)
```

Returns `nullptr` if no batches are available.

## Per-Operator Overrides

The core of the task creator's behavior comes from operator-specific overrides:

### HASH_JOIN (BUILD_PROBE mode)

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `get_next_task_hint()` | Tracks build state machine: `NOT_BUILT` → `SCHEDULING` → `SCHEDULED` → `BUILT`. Returns READY when both build and probe data available (NOT_BUILT) or probe data available (BUILT). |
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | `get_next_task_input_data_for_build_probe()`: On SCHEDULING → pop one build + one probe batch. On BUILT → pop one probe batch. |
| Why custom | Build/probe asymmetry: first task needs both sides, subsequent tasks only need probe |

State machine transitions:
```
NOT_BUILT: build_size>0 AND probe_size>0 → SCHEDULING (return READY)
SCHEDULING/SCHEDULED: → WAITING_FOR_INPUT_DATA (probe source)
BUILT: probe_size>0 → READY
```

### HASH_JOIN (STANDARD mode)

Uses base class for both `get_next_task_hint()` and `get_next_task_input_data()`. Input data walks the partition × left × right grid using snapshot batch IDs for Cartesian product iteration.

### PARTITION

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `get_next_task_hint()` | If the non-driving side has no `_num_partitions`, delegates to the sizing sibling's hint. Otherwise: base class. |
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | Mutex-locked with sibling to atomically determine partition count from the designated sizing side on first call. Notifies the hash join when build-side sizing can select an execution mode. Then delegates to base class. |
| Why custom | Sibling pair coordination: build normally sizes both sides; RIGHT-family joins other than `RIGHT_DELIM_JOIN` size both from the retained probe side. |

Deadlock prevention: both this and sibling partition locks are acquired in a fixed order using `std::scoped_lock`.

### CONCAT

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `get_next_task_hint()` | If source finished: READY if data exists. If `_concat_all`: WAITING. Otherwise: READY only if some partition holds a complete group — accumulated bytes strictly exceed `_concat_batch_bytes` (the overflowing batch seeds the next group); a lone oversized batch is deferred until a second batch arrives or the source finishes. |
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | Pulls the first partition with a complete group under the same policy as the hint (`plan_pull_for_partition`). Returns `partitioned_operator_data` with partition index. |
| Why custom | Byte-threshold batching; `_concat_all` mode for LEFT/ANTI/OUTER joins requires all data before output |

### SORT_SAMPLE

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `get_next_task_hint()` | If boundaries computed: base class. Otherwise: waits for N sample batches OR source finished. |
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | Base class (after boundary computation) |
| Why custom | Two-phase: cannot compute boundaries until N samples are collected |

### MERGE_SORT

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `get_next_task_hint()` | Base class (no override) |
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | Mutex-locked: drains ALL batches from one partition, advances `_current_partition_index`. |
| Why custom | One task per partition — must drain entire partition for multi-way merge |

### GROUPED_AGGREGATE_MERGE

Same pattern as MERGE_SORT: drains all batches from one partition per call, advancing partition index.

### TOP_N_MERGE

Same pattern as MERGE_SORT: drains all batches from one partition per call.

### DELIM_JOIN

| Method | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `get_next_task_input_data()` | Delegates to internal `partition_join` operator |
| Why custom | Wrapper pattern — the actual task creation is handled by the embedded join |

## Override Summary Table

| Operator | `get_next_task_hint()` | `get_next_task_input_data()` | Why Custom |
|----------|------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| HASH_JOIN (BUILD_PROBE) | Build state machine | Build+probe or probe only | Build/probe asymmetry |
| HASH_JOIN (STANDARD) | Base class | Cartesian product walk | Multi-partition iteration |
| PARTITION | Delegates to sizing sibling | Mutex-locked count determination | Sibling coordination |
| CONCAT | Byte-threshold check | Accumulate until threshold | Batching + blocking mode |
| SORT_SAMPLE | Wait for N batches | Base class | Two-phase sampling |
| MERGE_SORT | Base class | Drain all from one partition | Per-partition merge |
| GROUPED_AGGREGATE_MERGE | Base class | Drain all from one partition | Per-partition merge |
| TOP_N_MERGE | Base class | Drain all from one partition | Per-partition merge |
| DELIM_JOIN | N/A | Delegates to partition_join | Wrapper pattern |

## Task Creator Manager Loop

**File:** `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`

### Scan Scheduling Strategy

At query startup, exactly one scan is scheduled (`start_query()` schedules `scans.front()`). Every other scan is activated by the `get_next_task_hint()` topology-driven hint chain — avoiding excessive memory consumption from eagerly scanning all tables — or, under the `lookahead` strategy, by `schedule_lookahead()` when the task queue runs empty (see below).

```
while running:
    1. thread_pool.reserve()              -- wait for thread availability (bounded_thread_pool slot)
    2. _task_creation_queue.pop()         -- get next scheduling request
    3. node = get_operator_for_next_task(request.node)  -- follow hint chain
    4. if node is nullptr: re-evaluate the visited pipelines' status
       (update_pipeline_status(false), deduped per request) and continue

    5. Schedule work on the thread pool. Every source — a GPU_SCAN scan or any
       GPU operator with buffered input — drives the same loop:
           - Loop while (!node.all_ports_empty()):
             - pipeline.mark_task_created()  // BEFORE popping data
             - data = node.get_next_task_input_data()  // a GPU_SCAN blocks on its split_connector
             - If data: create a gpu_pipeline_task, dispatch to task_scheduler
             - If no data: pipeline.mark_task_completed()
             - If the request was a look-ahead: break after one task
```

The `mark_task_created()` call before data popping prevents a race condition where the pipeline could appear finished between data check and task creation.

### Look-ahead task creation

**Files:** `src/creator/config.hpp`, `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`

The task creator is constructed with a `task_creator_config` whose internal `strategy` is `request_type::active` (the current shipped, purely demand-driven policy) or `request_type::lookahead`. Under `lookahead`, `prepare_for_query` seeds that query's `lookahead_queue` with the plan's scan operators after the first. When the task scheduler's management loop finds its task queue empty, it calls `schedule_lookahead(device_hint)`: the creator walks the query's queue, skips finished pipelines, and pushes one request tagged `request_type::lookahead` for the next not-yet-activated operator. A look-ahead request creates a **single** task (the manager loop breaks instead of draining the source), so speculation warms a scan up without committing its full memory footprint. Look-ahead state is cleared by `drain_pending_tasks(query_id)` and `reset(query_id)` so no dangling operator pointers survive `QueryEnd`. This primitive is retained for engine-controlled policy; it is not exposed through YAML.

## Device Assignment for GPU Tasks

**File:** `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`

When the manager loop builds a `gpu_pipeline_task`, it also chooses the task's `preferred_device_id` (which GPU executor the scheduler should route it to). The choice is resolved in priority order: a device stamped on the input by its producer (a scan split's assigned GPU, or a partition's device), then data-locality by input bytes, then NUMA-affinity. Cached-scan inputs (a resident `scan_operator_input`, which is not a `pipelineable_operator_data`) are handled separately: a GPU-tier cached chunk pins to its own device, and a HOST-tier pinned chunk routes to a NUMA-local GPU via the topology index. The full locality math lives in [`multi-gpu-architecture.md`](multi-gpu-architecture.md); the partition pin is summarized here because it is a correctness requirement.

### Partition device pin

Partitioned operators — BUILD_PROBE hash join, `grouped_aggregate_merge`, and the other partition-keyed operators above — build a per-partition cuco hash table that is valid only on the GPU it was built on. Touching it from a stream bound to another device trips `cudaErrorInvalidValue`. So every task of a partition must run on one fixed device.

The task creator does not choose that device. The partition's consumer chooses a `partition_placement` (one device per partition) together with the partition count, PARTITION hands it to every operator that emits that exchange's partitions, and the emitter stamps the partition's device on the `partitioned_operator_data` it creates. The task creator reads it back through `get_preferred_device_id()` like a scan split's device. The default policy is round-robin, partition `p` on `active_gpu_ids[p % n]`, which keeps every task of a partition (build + all probes) on one GPU while spreading partitions across GPUs; see [multi-gpu-architecture.md](multi-gpu-architecture.md) for the broadcast and single-partition cases. Partitioned data with no index carries no stamp and is placed by locality.

Placements are drawn from the query's admitted set: `sirius_engine::initialize_internal` computes the admitted subset, installs it on the task creator via `set_active_gpu_ids()`, and builds `pipeline_build_context` from the same list, which the pipeline converter hands to every partition consumer. PARTITION rejects a placement that names a device outside it. See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for `topology.gpus_per_query`.

The other device preferences the task creator computes — the operator's own hint, GPU-resident byte counts, NUMA locality via `gpus_of()`, and a cached chunk's home device — are all derived from where data already lives and can name a device outside the admitted subset. They are clamped back into `_active_gpu_ids` at the point the preference is written to the task's local state. The clamp applies to stamped preferences too, as a backstop.

A task with no preference at all is confined the same way, but only when the query was admitted onto a strict subset. The scheduler hands an unpreferred task to whichever executor asks first, excluded ones included (a GPU_VALUES task carries no device-bound state and so sets no preference), so on a subset those tasks are pinned round-robin over `_active_gpu_ids`. Pinning costs the scheduler's freedom to place the task on whatever device frees up first, so it is skipped when nothing was narrowed away and there is nothing to confine.

The pin is reapplied on the OOM-reschedule path (`gpu_pipeline_executor`): when a task is rebuilt with a fresh local state, its per-task `preferred_device_id` is carried forward so a rescheduled probe doesn't lose its pin and scatter.

## `can_create_more_tasks()` and `has_processed_all_tasks()`

These methods signal task exhaustion:
- `can_create_more_tasks()` — returns false when no more tasks can be created (e.g., scan exhausted, all partitions processed)
- `has_processed_all_tasks()` — returns false when tasks are still in flight

Both throw `not implemented` in the base class and must be overridden by operators that need them.

## `drain_pending_tasks()`

**File:** `src/creator/task_creator.cpp`

`drain_pending_tasks(query_id)` is called during error cleanup and query reset:

1. Drains that query's requests from `_task_creation_queue` using its query index.
2. Waits for that query's in-flight task-creation lambdas to finish.
3. Clears that query's look-ahead queue and cursor under its state mutex.

The shared queue remains open for other queries.
