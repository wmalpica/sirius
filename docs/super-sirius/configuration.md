# Configuration

This document covers Super Sirius configuration: the `sirius_config` class, operator parameters, thread pool settings, and DuckDB SET variables.

## `sirius_config`

**File:** `src/include/sirius_config.hpp`

The `sirius_config` class loads configuration from a YAML file or uses built-in defaults. It provides:

- Hardware topology (GPU count, NUMA layout)
- Memory space configurations (GPU, Host, Disk)
- Thread pool configs for all executor types
- Operator parameters (batch sizes, limits)
- Telemetry options

### Config File Resolution

Sirius searches for a config file in this order:

1. **`SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE`** environment variable — explicit path
2. **`./sirius.yaml`** — current working directory
3. **`~/.sirius/sirius.yaml`** — user's home directory

If no config file is found, Sirius initializes with built-in defaults (95% GPU memory, 90% of each NUMA node's RAM as pinned host memory).

### Concurrent query admission

`sirius.max_concurrent_queries` is a positive startup integer, default **1**, shared by
connections to one DatabaseInstance. It bounds initialization through retirement. Additional
queries wait in a cancellable FIFO queue. The former
`sirius.executor.scan_manager.max_concurrent_queries` key is a deprecated alias; conflicting
values fail configuration loading. See [Concurrent queries](concurrent-queries.md) for the
maintenance, error and multi-GPU contracts.

### `SIRIUS_DISABLE`

Set `SIRIUS_DISABLE=1` to prevent Super Sirius from initializing. Useful for CPU-only benchmarks, since Super Sirius claims most GPU and pinned host memory on startup.

```bash
export SIRIUS_DISABLE=1
```

These related modes have different behavior:

| Mode | Query execution | NVTX/Quent behavior |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| `SIRIUS_DISABLE=1` | Ordinary SQL runs in DuckDB; Super Sirius is never attempted | Sirius does not create its Quent context or configure automatic NVTX injection |
| `SET gpu_execution = false` | Ordinary SQL runs in DuckDB for that connection | The process-wide Sirius runtime remains initialized and, when Quent is enabled, NVTX injection remains armed because the setting is reversible and other connections may use Sirius; DuckDB emits no NVTX events unless DuckDB or another loaded component explicitly calls NVTX |
| Automatic CPU fallback | Sirius first rejects the GPU plan or fails during GPU execution, then DuckDB executes the CPU plan | NVTX remains active so any Sirius/libcudf work before the fallback is retained; the DuckDB portion emits events only if the executing code calls NVTX |

Use `SIRIUS_DISABLE=1` for a pure DuckDB CPU baseline in a process that contains the Sirius extension. Use `SET gpu_execution = false` when the initialized Sirius runtime must remain available to turn back on later.

### Byte Suffixes

Any integer config value that represents bytes supports human-readable suffixes:

| Suffix | Base | Example | Bytes |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| `K`, `KB` | 1000 | `500K` | 500,000 |
| `Ki`, `KiB` | 1024 | `500Ki` | 512,000 |
| `M`, `MB` | 1000² | `512M` | 512,000,000 |
| `Mi`, `MiB` | 1024² | `512Mi` | 536,870,912 |
| `G`, `GB` | 1000³ | `8G` | 8,000,000,000 |
| `Gi`, `GiB` | 1024³ | `8Gi` | 8,589,934,592 |
| `T`, `TB` | 1000⁴ | `1T` | 1,000,000,000,000 |
| `Ti`, `TiB` | 1024⁴ | `1Ti` | 1,099,511,627,776 |

Fractional values are supported (e.g. `1.5Gi`). Follows the [Kubernetes resource units](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory) convention.

```yaml
sirius:
  memory:

## Memory Configuration

Sirius uses cuCascade for tiered memory management across GPU, Host (pinned), and Disk tiers. The `memory` section provides a high-level interface that maps to cuCascade's underlying memory space configs.

### Topology

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `num_gpus` | int | all visible GPUs | Non-negative number of GPUs to use. Defaults to every GPU visible to topology discovery (honors `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`); `0` also means auto. Mutually exclusive with `gpu_ids`. |
| `gpu_ids` | list of int | — | Non-empty list of unique, non-negative GPU device IDs. Mutually exclusive with `num_gpus`. |
| `gpus_per_query` | int | `0` (all) | How many GPUs each query is allocated at admission time. `0` uses all active GPUs. Values exceeding the active GPU count are clamped to the full set. |

### GPU Memory (`sirius.memory.gpu`)

Controls how much GPU VRAM Sirius claims and when it starts evicting data to host memory.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `usage_limit_fraction` | double | 0.95 | Fraction of total VRAM to use as Sirius's GPU memory capacity. The remaining 5% is left for the CUDA runtime, cuDF temporaries, and other GPU consumers. Mutually exclusive with `usage_limit_bytes`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `usage_limit_bytes` | bytes | — | Absolute VRAM limit. Mutually exclusive with `usage_limit_fraction`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `reservation_limit_fraction` | double | 1.0 | Fraction of the GPU capacity (set by `usage_limit_*`) that can be reserved by pipeline tasks. Reservations are acquired before task execution and prevent overcommit. Mutually exclusive with `reservation_limit_bytes`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `reservation_limit_bytes` | bytes | — | Absolute reservation limit. Mutually exclusive with `reservation_limit_fraction`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `downgrade_trigger_fraction` | double (0,1] | 0.8 | Start evicting GPU-resident data to host when reserved memory exceeds this fraction of capacity. Must be greater than `downgrade_stop_fraction`. |
| `downgrade_stop_fraction` | double (0,1] | 0.6 | Stop evicting when reserved memory drops to this fraction of capacity. Must be less than `downgrade_trigger_fraction`; configuration loading rejects an invalid pair. |

The high-level GPU path keeps per-stream reservation tracking off. The
diagnostic control remains available only through the explicit low-level
`sirius.space.gpu[].per_stream_reservation` replacement surface.

### Host Memory (`sirius.memory.host`)

Controls pinned host memory pools. One pool group is created per NUMA node (auto-detected from hardware topology).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `capacity_fraction` | double (0,1] | 0.9 | Pinned host memory capacity as a fraction of **each backing NUMA node's total RAM** (read from `/sys/devices/system/node/node<id>/meminfo`). Mutually exclusive with `capacity_bytes`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. Initialization fails if a node's capacity cannot be determined. |
| `capacity_bytes` | bytes | — | Pinned host memory capacity **per NUMA node** as absolute bytes, allocated with `cudaMallocHost`. Mutually exclusive with `capacity_fraction`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `reservation_limit_fraction` | double | 1.0 | Fraction of host capacity that can be reserved. Mutually exclusive with `reservation_limit_bytes`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `reservation_limit_bytes` | bytes | — | Absolute reservation limit. Mutually exclusive with `reservation_limit_fraction`; configuration loading rejects both when both values are non-null. |
| `downgrade_trigger_fraction` | double (0,1] | 0.9 | Start evicting host-resident data to disk when reserved memory exceeds this fraction. Must be greater than `downgrade_stop_fraction`. Eviction also requires a configured `downgrade_root_dirs`; without one the downgrade executor logs a warning and skips. |
| `downgrade_stop_fraction` | double (0,1] | 0.8 | Stop evicting when reserved memory drops to this fraction. Must be less than `downgrade_trigger_fraction`; configuration loading rejects an invalid pair. |
| `block_size` | bytes | 1Mi | Size of each allocation block in the pool. Larger blocks reduce allocation overhead but waste memory on small allocations. |
| `pool_size` | int | 128 | Number of blocks per pool. Total pool capacity = `block_size × pool_size`. |
| `initial_number_pools` | int | 4 | Number of pools pre-allocated at startup. Additional pools are created on demand. Initial host footprint = `block_size × pool_size × initial_number_pools`. |

### Disk Memory (`sirius.memory.disk`)

Controls the disk spill tier. Data evicted from host memory is written here. Disk spilling is **disabled by default** (empty `downgrade_root_dirs`).

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `disk_id` | int | 0 | Identifier for the disk space. |
| `capacity_bytes` | bytes | 1Ti | Maximum disk space for spill files. |
| `downgrade_root_dirs` | string | "" | Directory path for spill files. **Must be set** to enable disk spilling. Use a fast local mount (NVMe preferred). |

### Input-table compression (`sirius.compression`)

These settings control optional Simpatico compression when
`pin_table` caches input tables. Prefer the per-call
`CALL pin_table(..., compression => true)` argument to request compression for a specific pin.
The settings below supply the default for calls that omit the argument and configure plan lookup
and retention gates. Compression also requires a matching plan in `input_plan_dir`; otherwise the
table is pinned uncompressed.

| Key | DuckDB setting | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|----------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_pin_table_compression` | `pin_table_compression` | bool | false | Default for `pin_table` calls that omit the `compression` argument. |
| `min_batch_size_bytes` | `pin_table_compression_min_batch_size_bytes` | bytes | 1Mi | Skip compression below this uncompressed batch size. `0` disables the size gate. |
| `max_compressed_fraction` | `pin_table_compression_max_compressed_fraction` | finite double >= 0 | 0.75 | Keep a compressed representation only at or below this fraction of the original batch size. `0` retains none; values above `1` deliberately permit expansion, primarily for testing encodability. |
| `input_plan_dir` | `pin_table_input_compression_plan_dir` | string | "" | Directory of per-table Simpatico plan files. An empty path leaves compression inactive. |

The YAML loader and DuckDB `SET` surface reject negative, NaN, and infinite
`max_compressed_fraction` values instead of silently changing retention behavior.

### How Downgrade Thresholds Work

Each memory tier uses a trigger/stop threshold pair to control data eviction:

```
  0%             downgrade_stop    downgrade_trigger     reservation_limit
  |─────────────────|─────────────────|────────────────────|───── capacity
       normal           hysteresis         evicting           denied
```

- Below `downgrade_stop`: normal operation, no eviction
- Between `stop` and `trigger`: no new evictions start, but in-flight evictions finish
- Above `downgrade_trigger`: actively evict data to the next lower tier
- Above `reservation_limit`: new reservations are denied (triggers OOM retry)

The gap between `trigger` and `stop` prevents oscillation — without it, evicting one batch could drop below trigger, then the next allocation re-triggers eviction.
Configuration loading enforces `0 < downgrade_stop_fraction < downgrade_trigger_fraction <= 1`
for both the high-level and low-level GPU and host surfaces. Missing or explicit-null
members retain their surface defaults before the pair is validated.

### Low-Level Explicit Memory Spaces (`sirius.space`) — advanced

> **Mutually exclusive with configured `sirius.memory` sub-blocks.** `sirius.space` is a low-level
> alternative that declares individual memory spaces directly, bypassing the high-level
> `sirius.memory` configurator. If any `sirius.space.{gpu,host,disk}` list is non-empty, the
> configuration loader rejects a simultaneous non-null `sirius.memory.{gpu,host,disk}` sub-block
> instead of silently ignoring it. A null memory sub-block is absent; a non-null mapping selects
> the high-level path even when the mapping is empty or its individual values are null. Empty
> `sirius.space` lists do not select the low-level path. This path is generally reserved for
> **low-level developer testing** — e.g. hand-placing spaces on specific devices/NUMA nodes. Most
> users should use `sirius.memory` instead.
>
> Note the key names differ from `sirius.memory`: capacities are `memory_capacity` (not
> `capacity_bytes`), and the GPU/host tiers key on `device_id` / `numa_id`.

Each tier is a **YAML sequence** of space configs. Byte fields accept suffixes; fractions are `[0,1]`.

#### `sirius.space.gpu[]` — one entry per GPU memory space

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `device_id` | int | 0 | CUDA device the space lives on. |
| `per_stream_reservation` | bool | false | Track reservations per CUDA stream (forced false unless set). |
| `reservation_limit_fraction` | double [0,1] | space default | Fraction of the space that may be reserved. |
| `downgrade_trigger_fraction` | double (0,1] | space default | Start evicting above this fraction. Must be greater than `downgrade_stop_fraction`. |
| `downgrade_stop_fraction` | double (0,1] | space default | Stop evicting below this fraction. Must be less than `downgrade_trigger_fraction`. |
| `memory_capacity` | bytes | space default | Absolute capacity of the space. |

#### `sirius.space.host[]` — one entry per host (pinned) memory space

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `numa_id` | int | 0 | NUMA node the pinned pool is bound to. |
| `reservation_limit_fraction` | double [0,1] | space default | Fraction of the space that may be reserved. |
| `downgrade_trigger_fraction` | double (0,1] | space default | Start evicting above this fraction. Must be greater than `downgrade_stop_fraction`. |
| `downgrade_stop_fraction` | double (0,1] | space default | Stop evicting below this fraction. Must be less than `downgrade_trigger_fraction`. |
| `memory_capacity` | bytes | space default | Absolute capacity of the space. |
| `block_size` | bytes | pool default | Allocation block size. |
| `pool_size` | int | pool default | Blocks per pool. |
| `initial_number_pools` | int | pool default | Pools pre-allocated at startup. |

#### `sirius.space.disk[]` — one entry per disk spill space

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `disk_id` | int | 0 | Identifier for the disk space. |
| `mount_path` | string | "" | Spill directory. |
| `memory_capacity` | bytes | space default | Maximum disk space for spill files. |

```yaml
sirius:
  # NOTE: do NOT also configure sirius.memory — the loader rejects both paths together.
  space:
    gpu:
      - { device_id: 0, memory_capacity: 40Gi, reservation_limit_fraction: 0.9 }
    host:
      - { numa_id: 0, memory_capacity: 32Gi, block_size: 1Mi, pool_size: 128 }
    disk:
      - { disk_id: 0, mount_path: /tmp/sirius_disk_memory, memory_capacity: 1Ti }
```

## Executor Configuration

**Files:** `src/include/exec/config.hpp`, `src/include/creator/config.hpp`

The `sirius.executor` block configures the thread pools and task scheduling. It has four
per-pool sub-blocks: `task_creator`, `pipeline`, `downgrade`, and `scan_manager`. The
`scan_manager` sub-block is large and is documented in
[Scan Manager & IO Configuration](#scan-manager--io-configuration) below.

The thread-pool sub-blocks use these common keys; pipeline affinity is the
hardware-derived exception described below:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `num_threads` | int (**> 0**) | per pool (below) | Worker threads in the pool. |
| `cpu_affinity` | list of int | — | Cores to pin task-creator and downgrade threads. GPU pipeline affinity is derived from the selected GPU's CPU topology. |

### `sirius.executor.task_creator`

Thread pool (default `num_threads: 1`). Task creation
policy and within-branch priority are internal: Sirius currently creates tasks
on demand and prioritizes source-side pipelines first. The former
`sirius.executor.task_creator.strategy` and
`sirius.executor.task_creator.priority_order` keys have been removed;
configurations that still contain either key must delete it.

### `sirius.executor.pipeline`

Thread pool only (default `num_threads: 4`). No extra keys.

### `sirius.executor.downgrade`

Thread pool (default `num_threads: 1`) plus:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `monitor_period` | int (ms) | 10 | Period of the memory-pressure monitor loop. Set to `0` to disable the monitor loop entirely. |

## Scan Manager & IO Configuration

**Files:** `src/scan_manager/config.hpp`, `src/io/uring/config.hpp`, `src/include/io/rest/config.hpp`, `src/io/cache/config.hpp`, `src/include/io/object_store_config.hpp`

The `sirius.executor.scan_manager` block configures the scan-metadata thread pool and the Sirius IO layer that feeds the GPU scan operators.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `num_threads` | int (**> 0**) | remaining cores (min 4) | Metadata-producer threads. Blocking coalescers run in a separate pool sized from query admission, so they cannot occupy producer capacity. |
| `cpu_affinity` | list of int | — | Cores to pin scan-manager threads to. |
| `backend` | enum: `sirius`, `kvikio` | `sirius` | IO backend for reads. `sirius` uses the Sirius IO stack (`io_uring` for local paths, REST for `s3://`); `kvikio` serves both local files and `s3://` objects through kvikIO (local files through its file handle, objects through its remote handle); listing and glob expansion of `s3://` still go through the REST backend. Single-GPU only: a multi-GPU configuration is forced back to `sirius`. Values are lowercase. |
| `uring_n_reactors` | int (**> 0**) | 1 | Number of io_uring reactor threads for local-disk reads. |
| `rest_n_reactors` | int (**> 0**) | 2 | Number of REST reactor threads for object-store (`s3://`) reads. |
| `max_readahead_scans` | int | — (unset) | Scans the readahead may keep in flight, and the switch that runs it at all. See below. |
| `readahead_strategy` | enum: `eager`, `opportunistic` | — (unset) | When the readahead issues. Unset takes the serving backend's own preference: `eager` for object-store (REST) reads, `opportunistic` for local (uring) ones. Values are lowercase. |

Caching itself is configured in the [`cache`](#scan_managercache--read-path-caching-iocacheconfighpp)
sub-config below.

`max_readahead_scans` has three states:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| unset (default) | Defers to `cache`: with `mode` other than `none`, the budget is the backend reactor's own `n_max_concurrent_scans`; with `mode: none` the readahead does not run. |
| `0` | The readahead does not run, whatever the cache mode. |
| `n > 0` | The readahead runs with a budget of `n`, whatever the cache mode. |

`readahead_strategy` works the same way, deferring to the backend rather than to the cache:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| unset (default) | The serving backend's preference — `eager` for REST, `opportunistic` for uring. |
| `eager` | Every wake-up fills every free slot in the budget. An object-store round trip is dead time no matter what else is running, so only queue depth hides it. |
| `opportunistic` | One prefetch each time the executor deploys a task that is *not* a scan, i.e. only while the device is not already busy with the executor's own reads. A local device read competes with those, so issuing one mid-scan reorders the queue rather than adding throughput. |

When the readahead ends up `opportunistic` (either way), an *unset* `max_readahead_scans` schedules
against the pipeline pool's width rather than the backend's depth — one prefetch per non-scan
deployment is only useful while a pipeline thread could still pick up another scan. An explicit
`max_readahead_scans` wins over that substitution.

A query's local policy is selected from the serving backend publishing the widest budget.
A runtime budget additionally accounts for every backend touched by each split across all
queries. Demand reads borrow immediately; their debt pauses speculative prefetch. Events are
routed by query ID. A failed cache allocation gets one eviction retry before speculation yields.

Six optional nested sub-configs tune the individual backends, the cache, and the memory prefetcher:

### `scan_manager.uring` — io_uring backend (`io/uring/config.hpp`)

There are no static chunk-size or `readv`-fusion knobs. The worker chooses physical
operation sizes dynamically from backlog pressure, available slots, and the pinned block size.

### `scan_manager.rest` — REST / S3 backend (`io/rest/config.hpp`)

TLS verification policy and the CA bundle are configured only under
`scan_manager.object_store`. The REST reactor consumes those values so signing
and transport use one trust policy; there are no separate REST YAML controls.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `request_timeout_s` | int (seconds) | 30 | Whole-request timeout for control-plane requests (HEAD / LIST / footer probe / warmup) and the presigned-URL TTL, which is this value plus 60 s. `0` does not remove the limit: control-plane requests then keep the transport's built-in 30 s limit, and presigned URLs get a 300 s TTL. Data GETs use the stall detector below instead. |
| `stall_speed_limit_bytes` | int (bytes/s) | 65536 | Stall detector for data GETs: a transfer below this rate for `stall_time_s` consecutive seconds fails and is retried (0 disables). |
| `stall_time_s` | int (seconds) | 30 | How long a data GET may stay below `stall_speed_limit_bytes` before it is cut loose (0 disables). |
| `merge_max_gap` | bytes | 512Ki | Largest gap between two segments still fetched by a single GET. The bridged bytes are read and discarded, trading them for a saved round trip. 0 fuses only adjacent segments. |
| `upkeep_interval_ms` | int (ms) | 15000 | Idle-connection keepalive interval (`curl_easy_upkeep`; 0 disables). |
| `conn_max_age_s` | int (seconds) | 20 | Max age curl may reuse a pooled connection (`CURLOPT_MAXAGE_CONN`; 0 = curl default). |
| `retry_backoff_base_ms` | int (ms) | 50 | Base backoff between retries. |
| `retry_jitter_ms` | int (ms) | 50 | Random jitter added to retry backoff. |
| `max_retry_attempts` | int | 10 | Retry attempts for transient errors. |
| `max_auth_retry_attempts` | int | 3 | Retry attempts for HTTP 403 (expired presigned URL). Kept low so a genuine AccessDenied fails fast. |
| `honor_retry_after` | bool | true | Respect the server's `Retry-After` header. |
| `footer_probe_bytes` | bytes | 512Ki | Suffix-range window for the parquet footer probe. Must cover the footer, so err large. |
| `list_max_matches` | int | 100000 | Cap on files a glob/listing may accumulate (throws "narrow the glob prefix", never truncates). |
| `list_max_scanned` | int | 1000000 | Cap on objects a LIST sweep may scan across pages (throws, never truncates). |

Two REST values are deliberately not YAML keys. **Connections per reactor** is
fixed at 64 — the useful number is a property of one reactor thread, not of a
deployment, and more concurrency comes from adding reactors (`rest_n_reactors`),
each with its own thread to service them. **Physical GET size** is worker-owned:
the reactor derives a target between 4 MiB and 16 MiB from its queued logical
bytes and currently free connections. Large contiguous requests are balanced
under the 16 MiB ceiling. Fragmented cache fills are grouped only at whole
cache-chunk boundaries so a chunk is never published before all of its bytes
arrive.

`merge_max_gap` remains a logical planner hint: nearby ranges can be represented
as prepared slices without forcing a static physical layout. Device operations
allocate as many pinned CuCascade blocks as their selected physical range needs;
those blocks stay owned through curl retries, the asynchronous H2D copy, and its
CUDA completion event. Staging is therefore proportional to active device work
instead of being reserved as one fixed bounce slot per connection.

### `scan_manager.kvikio` — kvikIO backend (`io/kvikio/config.hpp`)

Used when `backend: kvikio` routes reads (local files and `s3://` objects)
to kvikIO. **Every key is optional and unset means "leave kvikIO's own default
alone"** — kvikIO seeds each setting from an environment variable at first use, so
omitting a key preserves that value and setting one overrides it.

**These are process-global.** Every key except `compat_mode` maps to a setter on
kvikIO's `defaults` singleton, so the last context constructed wins and the
setting is shared with every other kvikIO user in the process. Treat it as
startup configuration. `compat_mode` is the exception: it rides the file-handle
constructor, so it scopes to files this backend opens.

This backend runs without the prefetching cache and therefore without the
readahead, so `scan_manager.cache.*`, `max_readahead_scans` and
`readahead_strategy` have no effect on it.

| Key | Type | Env default | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|-------------|
| `nthreads` | int (**> 0**) | `KVIKIO_NTHREADS` (1) | Threads in kvikIO's task pool — the parallelism bound for a single read. |
| `task_size` | bytes (**> 0**) | `KVIKIO_TASK_SIZE` (4Mi) | Chunk size a parallel read is split into. Keep it a page multiple when `auto_direct_io_read` is on. |
| `gds_threshold` | bytes | `KVIKIO_GDS_THRESHOLD` (1Mi) | Minimum read size routed through GDS + the thread pool; smaller reads take a direct POSIX shortcut. 0 is legal. |
| `bounce_buffer_size` | bytes (**> 0**) | `KVIKIO_BOUNCE_BUFFER_SIZE` (16Mi) | Host staging buffer for device reads that cannot go straight to GPU memory. |
| `auto_direct_io_read` | bool | `KVIKIO_AUTO_DIRECT_IO_READ` | Use `O_DIRECT` for POSIX reads. POSIX path only — the cuFile/GDS path manages its own I/O mode. |
| `auto_direct_io_read_overread` | bool | `KVIKIO_AUTO_DIRECT_IO_READ_OVERREAD` (false) | Align device-read offsets down and sizes up to pages so the whole transfer is pure Direct I/O, at the cost of extra bytes. Requires `auto_direct_io_read`. |
| `thread_pool_per_block_device` | bool | `KVIKIO_THREAD_POOL_PER_BLOCK_DEVICE` (false) | Give each block device its own pool instead of sharing one global pool. |
| `compat_mode` | enum: `auto`, `on`, `off` | `KVIKIO_COMPAT_MODE` | cuFile vs POSIX selection, per file handle. `off` enforces cuFile/GDS, `on` enforces POSIX, `auto` tries cuFile and falls back. Values are lowercase. |

### `scan_manager.cache` — read-path caching (`io/cache/config.hpp`)

Everything about read-path caching lives in this one block — rather than a mode on the
scan manager and the cache's tunables in a sibling block.

```yaml
sirius:
  executor:
    scan_manager:
      cache:
        mode: sirius
        eviction: lru
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | enum: `none`, `os`, `sirius` | `none` | Which cache the read path goes through. Values are lowercase. |
| `eviction` | enum: `idle`, `lru` | `lru` | What retires an idle chunk from the Sirius cache. Only meaningful under `mode: sirius`. Values are lowercase. |
| `eviction_threshold_fraction` | double [0,1] | 0.8 | Start evicting when the cache pool fills to this fraction. |
| `min_prefetching_budget_fraction` | double [0,1] | 0.05 | Floor of the pool reserved for prefetching. |

`mode: none` bypasses every cache (`O_DIRECT`, no prefetching cache). `mode: os` reads
through the kernel page cache instead. `mode: sirius` reads `O_DIRECT` into Sirius's own
pinned prefetching cache.

`eviction: lru` keeps idle chunks for reuse and evicts least-recently-used ones once the
pool fills past `eviction_threshold_fraction`; `eviction: idle` drops each chunk as soon as
it goes idle, making the cache a prefetch staging area sized for the reads in flight rather
than for reuse.

Those two knobs derive the settings below, which are therefore **not** individually settable from YAML:

| Derived setting | Derived from |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `uring.use_odirect` | `mode` — true for everything but `os` |
| whether the prefetching cache is armed | `mode` — only under `sirius` |
| `dispose_on_idle` | `eviction` — true under `idle` |
| the readahead's default budget | `mode` — the readahead does not run under `none`; see [`max_readahead_scans`](#scan-manager--io-configuration) |

### `scan_manager.object_store` — S3 credentials & endpoint (`io/object_store_config.hpp`)

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `endpoint` | string | "" | S3 endpoint URL. |
| `region` | string | "" | AWS region. |
| `access_key` / `secret_key` | string | "" | Static credentials. |
| `session_token` | string | "" | STS session token for temporary credentials. |
| `signing_mode` | enum: `presigned`, `header` | `presigned` | SigV4 form: `presigned` (auth in the URL query string) or `header` (`Authorization` + `x-amz-*` headers). Values are lowercase. |
| `s3_transport` | enum: `auto`, `http`, `https`, `rdma` | `auto` | Transport selection. Values are lowercase; `https` is an alias for `http`. `auto` lets the backend choose from the URI scheme and endpoint. |
| `ca_bundle_path` | string | "" | Sole YAML source for the REST endpoint's PEM CA bundle. |
| `tls_verify` | bool | true | Sole YAML source for REST endpoint certificate verification. |

### `scan_manager.memory_prefetcher` — background host→GPU upload of pinned-cache scan splits (`scan_manager/config.hpp`)

Overlaps the host→GPU upload of queued pinned-cache scan splits with compute:
worker threads walk the pending splits in scan execution order and convert
resident batches to GPU tier ahead of task creation, gated on GPU memory
headroom (see `scan_manager/memory_prefetcher.hpp`). Disabled by default. Workers rotate over
the query's admitted GPUs, use per-device reservations and exclusive stream leases, and release
those leases before parking. Multi-GPU concurrency still requires actual hardware qualification.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable` | bool | false | Master switch for the prefetcher. |
| `num_threads` | int (**> 0**) | 2 | Prefetch worker threads; each drives one in-flight batch conversion on its own stream. |
| `min_free_fraction` | double [0,1] | 0.4 | Keep at least this fraction of the GPU space free after each prefetch; conversions (and their reservations) are only attempted above this floor. |
| `poll_interval_ms` | int (**> 0**) | 2 | Worker sweep interval while waiting for headroom / new splits. |
| `drain_quiet_ms` | int (ms) | 100 | A connector counts as actively draining (and is skipped) until this long passes since its last pop. Must exceed the scan's inter-pop interval. |

## Operator Parameters

**File:** `src/include/sirius_config.hpp` — `operator_params` struct

The four batch/partition sizes (`scan_task_batch_size`, `hash_partition_bytes`,
`concat_batch_bytes`, `sort_sample_bytes`) share one built-in default. Without an
explicit GPU capacity in YAML, it is computed at startup as
`clamp(smallest visible physical GPU memory / 40, 512 MiB, 5 GiB)` (800 MiB when no
GPU is visible). When the active YAML memory path explicitly caps GPU capacity, the
default is narrowed to
`min(physical-memory default, max(1 byte, smallest resolved GPU capacity / 40))`.
`max_build_hash_table_bytes` defaults to **2× that batch default**. Explicit
`operator_params` values are applied afterward and still override each value
individually.

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `scan_task_batch_size` | Shared physical/effective GPU batch default described above | Target batch size for DuckDB scan tasks; must be greater than zero |
| `enable_compressed_materialization` | true | Store eligible integer and fixed-point DECIMAL values in value-preserving narrower carriers when exact pin-time bounds permit it; restore native carriers at type-sensitive boundaries. |
| `max_sort_partition_bytes` | 0 (auto) | Max bytes per sort partition. Auto = 33% of GPU memory. |
| `hash_partition_bytes` | Shared physical/effective GPU batch default described above | Target partition size for hash joins and group-bys; must be greater than zero |
| `concat_batch_bytes` | Shared physical/effective GPU batch default described above | Target output batch size for CONCAT operator |
| `sort_sample_bytes` | Shared physical/effective GPU batch default described above | Bytes sampled before computing sort partition boundaries |
| `max_build_hash_table_bytes` | 2× batch default | Max build-side size for BUILD_PROBE join mode |
| `max_broadcast_join_size` | 256 MiB | Max build-side size eligible for a broadcast join. A build below this size is replicated to every GPU (instead of hash-partitioned) when it is tiny, or when the DuckDB-estimated probe-to-build row ratio is at least `num_gpus * 1.25`. |
| `max_sort_partition_memory_fraction` | 0.33 | Fraction of GPU memory per sort partition when `max_sort_partition_bytes` is 0 |
| `mark_join_build_switch_ratio` | 8.0 | For STANDARD MARK joins, build on the smaller (left) side when `right_rows >= ratio * left_rows` (0 disables) |
| `enable_dynamic_filter` | true | Enable runtime filters for eligible hash joins. Plan-time wiring admits keys by join type (not join mode); at delivery, any join whose build side arrives as one whole batch publishes — a single-partition or broadcast `BUILD_PROBE` build, and a single-partition `STANDARD`/`MIXED_JOIN` build on the same terms. Targets may be probe scans or join-edge endpoints. An eligible build selects a raw exact IN-list for 1–12 supported build rows, otherwise a hash IN-list within the L2 budget or a Bloom. |
| `enable_dynamic_zone_map_filter` | false | Publish build-key min/max filters in addition to membership filters. Parquet scans use them for row-group pruning; duckdb-native scans apply them post-decode. Requires `enable_dynamic_filter`; intended for clustered-keyset workloads. |
| `dynamic_filter_domain_coverage_threshold` | 0.9 | Positive finite threshold. Before constructing either a membership filter or zone map, skip the key when the complete build covers at least this fraction of the key's unfiltered base-table row bound. Applies only to build keys proven unique in their base relation, with evidence from DuckDB-native scans. Values above 1.0 disable the gate; exactly 1.0 fires only at full coverage. |
| `dynamic_filter_inlist_max_l2_fraction` | 0.125 | Finite threshold in [0, 1]: maximum estimated cuco-set size for the exact hash IN-list, as a fraction of the smallest probe-GPU L2. Larger sets use Bloom when supported. For keys not handled by the raw IN-list, 0 selects Bloom when supported, while 1.0 reproduces the legacy L2-fit rule only when L2 size is known. If L2 size is unknown, the hash IN-list is ineligible and selection falls back to Bloom or no membership filter. The 0.125 default comes from a GB300 residency sweep: hash-set probe cost is flat below ~0.28 of L2 and degrades beyond it, while Bloom was at least 2.2x faster at every swept set size. |
| `enable_runtime_distinct_build_probe` | true | For `BUILD_PROBE` INNER/LEFT equality joins whose build-key uniqueness the planner could not prove, test distinctness at runtime (one `cudf::distinct_count` pass over the cached build, dimension-scale builds only) and take the single-pass `cudf::distinct_hash_join` instead of the general two-pass join when the keys are distinct. |
| `enable_dense_count_join` | true | Fuse `COUNT(col \| *) GROUP BY <preserved-side join key>` over a LEFT/RIGHT integer equi-join into the `DENSE_COUNT_JOIN` operator (TPC-H q13 shape): a direct-address count histogram over the preserved key domain replaces the join build, output materialization, and re-aggregation. |
| `dense_count_join_max_bytes` | 2 GiB | Cap on `DENSE_COUNT_JOIN`'s combined direct-address histogram footprint; a key domain too wide for the budget takes the operator's exact sparse (eager-aggregation) strategy. Must be greater than zero. |
| `dynamic_filter_keep_threshold` | 0.9 | Finite threshold in [0, 1] for disabling post-decode filtering once a measured split keeps more than this fraction of its rows; 1.0 keeps filtering always on. |
| `enable_pinned_zone_map_pruning` | true | Capture per-chunk min/max statistics while pinning and use them to skip cached chunks that cannot match a scan filter. |
| `admission_bytes_per_gpu` | 0 (off) | Target projected scan-output bytes per GPU. At admission the engine estimates a query's total scan output and takes the smallest GPU subset that keeps each GPU under this figure, bounded by `topology.gpus_per_query`. `0` disables the estimate, leaving the allocation to `topology.gpus_per_query` alone. |
| `avg_variable_column_bytes` | 32 | Per-row width assumed for variable-width columns (VARCHAR, LIST, STRUCT, ARRAY) when estimating scan output. Fixed-width columns use their real carrier width. Only consulted when `admission_bytes_per_gpu` is non-zero. |
| `enable_runtime_size_estimation` | false | Size grouped-aggregation partitions from projected input, allowing a partial ingress barrier. |

**Note:** `admission_bytes_per_gpu` is a parallelism dial, not a memory budget. Peak GPU residency is bounded by partition sizing (`hash_partition_bytes` and the batch settings), not by the admitted GPU count — a query on fewer GPUs processes more partitions sequentially at roughly unchanged peak memory, trading wall-clock for freed devices. Tune it against how much of the fleet a query should occupy, not against VRAM.

**Note:** `max_build_hash_table_bytes` can be larger than `concat_batch_bytes`. When it is, the partition operator configures CONCAT to concatenate all batches, enabling the more efficient BUILD_PROBE join mode for larger build sides. Other joins (STANDARD, MIXED) still use `concat_batch_bytes` as the batch size threshold.

Runtime distinct-build probing is an internal join policy, not a user configuration choice. It is
temporarily disabled while the cuCollections defect tracked in #1600 remains unresolved. The
engine retains the guarded single-pass `cudf::distinct_hash_join` path for policy-controlled use
after that dependency is fixed.

## Telemetry

```yaml
sirius:
  telemetry:
    enable_quent: true
    output_directory: telemetry_data
    engine_name: siriusDB
```

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_quent` | bool | true | Emit Quent telemetry using the configured exporter. When false, telemetry uses the noop exporter. |
| `exporter` | string | `ndjson` | Quent filesystem exporter: `ndjson`, `msgpack`, or `postcard`. |
| `output_directory` | non-empty string | `telemetry_data` | Directory for Quent telemetry files. |
| `engine_name` | non-empty string | `siriusDB` | Engine name reported in engine-level telemetry. |
| `nvtx_injection_lib` | string | empty | Optional NVTX injection-library override. Normally unnecessary: a loadable Sirius uses its own DSO, while a Sirius-enabled DuckDB executable resolves the initializer from itself. `NVTX_INJECTION64_PATH` takes precedence. |

Per-query labels are configured separately from YAML. They can be set with the
`sirius_set_query_label` SQL function or inline with the `query_label` named
parameter on `gpu_execution(...)`:

```sql
-- Applies to the next Sirius query, including transparent plain-SQL execution.
CALL sirius_set_query_label('tpch_q1_iter1');
SELECT *
FROM lineitem
WHERE l_orderkey < 100;

-- Inline label for an explicit gpu_execution call.
CALL gpu_execution(
  'SELECT * FROM lineitem WHERE l_orderkey < 100',
  query_label = 'tpch_q1_iter1'
);
```

`sirius_set_query_label` is consumed once by the next Sirius query. For explicit
`gpu_execution(...)`, an inline `query_label` parameter takes precedence over a
pending label set with `sirius_set_query_label`.

### Generating Query Telemetry

To generate telemetry from Sirius queries, update the Sirius config file used by
the query run and enable Quent export:

```yaml
sirius:
  telemetry:
    enable_quent: true
    output_directory: telemetry_data
    engine_name: siriusDB
```

Load that config through the normal config resolution path, usually by setting
`SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/sirius.yaml`. Any Sirius query run with
`enable_quent: true` writes Quent ndjson files into `output_directory` by default. Set
`exporter: postcard` for compact benchmark or CI telemetry.

For TPC-H Parquet runs, the helper script runs queries and labels each
`(query, iteration)` pair before executing it:

```bash
pixi run -- ./test/tpch_performance/run_tpch_parquet_and_generate_telemetry.sh \
  --iterations 1 \
  --parquet-dir /data/tpch/sf100/p16/zstd-8/ \
  100
```

Pass `--config <path>` to use a full Sirius config. If no query numbers are
provided, the script runs all 22 TPC-H queries.

Start the Quent analyzer server over the same telemetry directory to view the
captured telemetry:

```bash
pixi run quent
```

The `quent` Pixi task defaults to `telemetry_data`, and runs the telemetry
server with the UI enabled. If the config uses a different `output_directory`,
pass that path as the task argument:

```bash
pixi run quent /path/to/telemetry_data
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` and select the captured Sirius engine/query.

## Thread Pool Configuration

Summary of the four executor thread pools. See [Executor Configuration](#executor-configuration)
and [Scan Manager & IO Configuration](#scan-manager--io-configuration) for the full YAML keys and
per-pool extras.

| Pool | YAML block | Default Threads | Thread Name Prefix | Purpose |
|------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| `task_creator` | `executor.task_creator` | 1 | `task_creator` | Task creation from scheduling requests |
| `gpu_pipeline_executor` | `executor.pipeline` | 4 | `gpu_pipeline` | GPU pipeline task execution |
| `downgrade_executor` | `executor.downgrade` | 1 | `downgrade` | Data tier migration (GPU→Host) |
| `scan_manager` | `executor.scan_manager` | remaining cores (min 4) | `scan_manager` | Scan metadata production + IO reactor management |

The task-creator, downgrade, and scan-manager pools support optional CPU affinity lists
(`cpu_affinity`) for core pinning. GPU pipeline affinity is derived per executor from the selected
GPU's CPU topology. `num_threads` must be `> 0` for every pool.

At execution, sort partition caps are bounded by the smallest configured GPU capacity divided
by `max_concurrent_queries`, multiplied by `max_sort_partition_memory_fraction`. Explicit
`max_sort_partition_bytes` values can reduce that cap further. The bound uses configured capacity
rather than another query's momentary free-memory usage.

## DuckDB SET Variables

Registered in `src/sirius_extension.cpp`. Operator, expression and compression options are
connection-local overrides of YAML defaults; GLOBAL writes are rejected and RESET restores the
registered default. Each execution uses one immutable operator-options snapshot. Logging updates
serialize runtime-wide. Hardware decompression requires startup configuration.

### Logging

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `sirius_log_backend` | `spdlog` | Log sink: `spdlog`, `duckdb`, or `noop` |
| `sirius_log_level` | `info` | Log level: trace, debug, info, warn, error, critical, off (`spdlog` only) |
| `sirius_log_dir` | `log` | Log output directory (`spdlog` only) |
| `sirius_log_flush_seconds` | 3 | Log flush interval in seconds; 0 disables periodic flushing and negative values are rejected (`spdlog` only) |

- **`spdlog`** (default): writes the daily-rotated `<sirius_log_dir>/sirius.log`, honouring
  `sirius_log_level` and `sirius_log_flush_seconds`.
- **`duckdb`**: routes logs into DuckDB's own logging under the `Sirius` log type; enable and
  read them with `CALL enable_logging(); SELECT * FROM duckdb_logs WHERE type = 'Sirius';`.
  Level and enable are governed by DuckDB, not `sirius_log_level`.
- **`noop`**: discards all logs.

These can also be set at load via the `SIRIUS_LOG_BACKEND`, `SIRIUS_LOG_DIR`, and
`SIRIUS_LOG_LEVEL` environment variables.

The embedded FFI engine reads these variables when it constructs a `sirius::ffi::Context`.
If none is set, it leaves the current log sink unchanged. If only `SIRIUS_LOG_LEVEL` is set,
the default `spdlog` backend writes to `./log/sirius.log`; if only `SIRIUS_LOG_DIR` is set,
the default `spdlog` backend writes there. An unknown backend leaves the current sink in
place. With `spdlog`, an unknown level falls back to `info` and emits a warning. The `duckdb`
backend needs a DuckDB database when the sink is installed, so selecting it in the FFI path
does not create a sink; this path has no SQL or settings entry point to enable or read DuckDB
logging. If the selected sink cannot be constructed, such as when the log directory is not
writable, context construction throws and restores the previous `Config::LOG_*` values while
leaving the previous sink active.

### Expression Evaluation

**File:** `src/include/expression_evaluator/expression_evaluator_strategy.hpp`

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `expression_evaluator_strategy` | `ast_interpret` | Expression evaluator strategy: `materialize`, `ast_interpret`, or `ast_jit` |

`expression_executor_strategy` remains registered as a deprecated compatibility alias for
`expression_evaluator_strategy`; new configuration should use the evaluator name.

### Scan

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_compressed_materialization` | true | Keep eligible integer and fixed-point DECIMAL values in narrower physical carriers until a native semantic boundary. |

The scan-task batch target is derived from effective GPU capacity. Advanced
benchmark and test envelopes may still override `scan_task_batch_size` in YAML
under `sirius.operator_params`, where it must remain greater than zero, but it
is not a normal session setting.

`enable_compressed_materialization` is also accepted in YAML under `sirius.operator_params`.
At pin time, exact per-chunk bounds select stored carriers. At query planning, a matching pinned
entry's recorded column-storage metadata determines the scan carriers; Parquet footer and DuckDB
catalog statistics are not consulted for this decision. Unpinned scans stay native, and exact
runtime bounds guard any narrowing cast required after a plan becomes stale. Changing the setting
does not rewrite an existing pinned entry; cached scans normalize its stored carriers for the
current query. See [Compressed Materialization](compressed-materialization.md) for eligibility,
restoration boundaries, and cache-reservation behavior.

```sql
SET enable_compressed_materialization = false;
```

### Pipeline / Operator

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `max_sort_partition_bytes` | 0 (auto) | Max sort partition bytes |
| `max_sort_partition_memory_fraction` | 0.33 | Auto sort-partition fraction when `max_sort_partition_bytes` is 0 |
| `hash_partition_bytes` | Shared physical/effective GPU batch default | Hash partition target size; must be greater than zero |
| `sort_sample_bytes` | Shared physical/effective GPU batch default | Bytes sampled before computing sort boundaries |
| `max_build_hash_table_bytes` | 2× batch default | Max build-side hash table bytes |
| `max_broadcast_join_size` | 256 MiB | Max build-side size eligible for a broadcast join |
| `mark_join_build_switch_ratio` | 8.0 | STANDARD MARK join build-side switch ratio (0 disables) |
| `enable_dense_count_join` | true | Enable the fused count-over-outer-join operator; accepted only as a strict boolean under `sirius.operator_params`. |

Eligible GROUP BY and TOP_N merge pipelines are fused automatically. This is an engine-owned plan
policy rather than a user configuration choice; see
[Merge fusion](physical-plan-generation.md#merge-fusion).

The CONCAT output-batch target is derived from effective GPU capacity. Advanced
benchmark and test envelopes may still override `concat_batch_bytes` in YAML
under `sirius.operator_params`, but it is not a normal session setting.

Runtime distinct-build probing is also engine-owned and is temporarily disabled pending #1600.

Dense count-join is enabled by default and can be disabled with
`sirius.operator_params.enable_dense_count_join: false`. Both inputs are FULL barriers and are
hash-partitioned on the join key, so one partition of each input plus its workspace must fit one
GPU task. Its histogram budget is engine-owned and applies per partition task.

### GPU Admission

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `admission_bytes_per_gpu` | 0 (off) | Target projected scan-output bytes per GPU; `0` disables the estimate, leaving the allocation to `topology.gpus_per_query` |
| `avg_variable_column_bytes` | 32 | Per-row width assumed for variable-width columns when estimating scan output; must be greater than zero |

Both take effect from the next query, since admission runs per query. `topology.gpus_per_query`
is YAML-only — it is read once when the GPU memory spaces are configured.

```sql
SET admission_bytes_per_gpu = 34359738368;  -- 32 GiB
```

### Dynamic Filters

Dynamic membership-filter pushdown is automatic and enabled by default. The
clustered-keyset zone-map path is automatic-off by default because it does not
repay its row-level cost on scattered keys. Advanced benchmark and diagnosis
envelopes can override either behavior in YAML under `sirius.operator_params`.

`enable_dynamic_filter` replaces the former `enable_dynamic_filter_pushdown` and the temporary
`enable_dynamic_filter_sip`; the old keys are not aliased — a YAML file still naming them is
rejected as unknown, and the old `SET` variables no longer exist.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_dynamic_filter` | true | Enable runtime filters for eligible hash joins. Plan-time wiring admits keys by join type (not join mode); at delivery, any join whose build side arrives as one whole batch publishes — a single-partition or broadcast `BUILD_PROBE` build, and a single-partition `STANDARD`/`MIXED_JOIN` build on the same terms. Targets may be probe scans or join-edge endpoints. An eligible build selects a raw exact IN-list for 1–12 supported build rows, otherwise a hash IN-list within the L2 budget or a Bloom. |
| `enable_dynamic_zone_map_filter` | false | Publish build-key min/max filters in addition to membership filters. Parquet scans use them for row-group pruning; duckdb-native scans apply them post-decode. Requires `enable_dynamic_filter`; intended for clustered-keyset workloads. |
| `dynamic_filter_domain_coverage_threshold` | 0.9 | Positive finite threshold. Before constructing either a membership filter or zone map, skip the key when the complete build covers at least this fraction of the key's unfiltered base-table row bound. Applies only to build keys proven unique in their base relation, with evidence from DuckDB-native scans. Values above 1.0 disable the gate; exactly 1.0 fires only at full coverage. |
| `dynamic_filter_inlist_max_l2_fraction` | 0.125 | Finite threshold in [0, 1]: maximum estimated cuco-set size for the exact hash IN-list, as a fraction of the smallest probe-GPU L2. Larger sets use Bloom when supported. For keys not handled by the raw IN-list, 0 selects Bloom when supported, while 1.0 reproduces the legacy L2-fit rule only when L2 size is known. If L2 size is unknown, the hash IN-list is ineligible and selection falls back to Bloom or no membership filter. The 0.125 default comes from a GB300 residency sweep: hash-set probe cost is flat below ~0.28 of L2 and degrades beyond it, while Bloom was at least 2.2x faster at every swept set size. |
| `dynamic_filter_keep_threshold` | 0.9 | Finite threshold in [0, 1] for disabling post-decode filtering once a measured split keeps more than this fraction of its rows; 1.0 keeps filtering always on. |

The direct DuckDB session overrides are registered only when the process
explicitly enables Sirius test options; they are not part of the normal user
surface.

### Pinned Tables

Pinned-table zone-map capture and pruning are automatic. The advanced YAML escape hatch is under
`sirius.operator_params` for benchmark and diagnosis envelopes; it is not a normal session choice.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_pinned_zone_map_pruning` | true | Capture pinned-chunk zone maps at pin time and use them to prune cached scans. |

Setting the YAML value to `false` before startup avoids the extra GPU reductions and creates a
statless entry. Enabling it later does not add statistics to that entry; re-pin the table with
the setting enabled. See
[Pinned-table zone maps](scan.md#zone-maps) for supported types, pruning, and re-pin behavior.

The direct DuckDB `SET` override is registered only when the process explicitly enables Sirius
test options; it is not part of the normal user surface.

### Pinned-Table Compression (Simpatico)

Prefer the per-call `pin_table(..., compression => true/false)` argument for a specific pin. The
variables below supply the default for calls that omit the argument and configure plan lookup and
retention gates.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `pin_table_compression` | false | Default for `pin_table` calls that omit the `compression` argument. |
| `pin_table_input_compression_plan_dir` | (empty) | Directory of per-table Simpatico plan files (`<table_name>.<ext>`, multi-column plan DSL). Tables with no matching file are pinned uncompressed. No effect on spill compression. |
| `pin_table_compression_min_batch_size_bytes` | 1 MiB | Minimum uncompressed batch size below which pin-table compression is skipped. |
| `pin_table_compression_max_compressed_fraction` | 0.75 | Discard the compressed form and pin uncompressed when the compressed size exceeds this fraction of the original (compression saved too little). |

Both size gates are evaluated on the narrowed table when compressed materialization is active.
See [Compressed Pinning](compressed-pinning.md) for tier selection, plan authoring, and results.

### Late Materialization (experimental)

Off by default, and gated by environment variables rather than `sirius_config`/`SET` — this is
still an experimental optimization, not a normal session choice.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SIRIUS_EXP_LATE_MAT` | off | The master gate. Carries a pin-order rowid instead of scanned values for a GPU-tier pinned table, restoring them at the far end. |
| `SIRIUS_EXP_LATE_MAT_PIN_UNIQUE_COLS` | off | Columns the pin-time uniqueness probe observes: `all`, a name list, or `none`. Required for a group-by-rowid ride or a rider to be admissible at all. |

Five further `SIRIUS_EXP_LATE_MAT_*` knobs tune the deferral floors and the count-on-deferred
path; see [Late Materialization](late-materialization.md#turning-it-on-experimental) for the full
gate table, the mechanism, and results.

### Runtime Data Size Estimation

Runtime estimation projects the total bytes that will reach an input port from measured upstream
ratios. Its current consumer is the grouped-aggregation `PARTITION`, which can overlap with its
producer after an estimate is available. The disabled path retains the original `FULL` barrier.

The partition logs its sizing basis (`projected`, `upstream-complete`, or `measured`) and final
error. See [Data Size Estimation](data-size-estimation.md) for the design.

```sql
SET enable_runtime_size_estimation = true;   -- off by default
```

### Transparent Execution

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `gpu_execution` | true | Enable transparent GPU execution for plain SQL queries. When enabled, supported queries are automatically intercepted and executed on the GPU. When disabled, only explicit `CALL gpu_execution('...')` uses the GPU. |

### Debug

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `enable_duckdb_fallback` | true | Fall back to DuckDB CPU execution on Sirius errors. Gates both plan-time fallback (unsupported operator/type) and runtime fallback (GPU execution failure) on the transparent path, plus explicit `CALL gpu_execution(...)`. Set to `false` to surface Sirius errors instead of falling back. |
| `enable_regex_jit_impl` | true | Use JIT regex implementation |
| `like_swar_fastpath` | true | Dispatch `%lit1%lit2%...%` LIKE/NOT LIKE patterns to the SWAR digram fast-path kernel instead of `cudf::strings::like` |


## Compile-Time Config Flags

### Static flags

**File:** `src/include/config.hpp`

Static constants from `namespace duckdb::Config` and `namespace sirius::Config`:

| Flag | Value | Namespace |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `EXPRESSION_EVALUATOR_STRATEGY` | `ast_interpret` | `duckdb::Config` |
| `NUM_GPU_EXECUTOR_THREADS` | 2 | `sirius::Config` |
| `NUM_PIPELINE_EXECUTOR_THREADS` | 1 | `sirius::Config` |
| `NUM_GPU` | 1 | `sirius::Config` |

These are compile-time defaults. Runtime configuration via `sirius_config` and DuckDB SET variables takes precedence.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/sirius_config.hpp` | Config class, operator_params, thread pool configs |

| `src/sirius_extension.cpp` | SET variable registration |
| `src/scan_manager/config.hpp` | Scan manager config (thread pool, IO reactors, readahead, object store) |
| `src/io/cache/config.hpp` | Read-path caching config (`scan_manager.cache`: mode, eviction policy, prefetching-cache tunables) |

## Tuned profile: GB300, TPC-H SF1000 host-pinned

Measured 2026-07-31 (72-core GB300, 256 GB HBM, 3 hot iterations, results
byte-identical to defaults). Relative to the stock config the following
deltas are worth **-13% suite hot time** (20.8 s → 18.1 s; q9 -19%):

```yaml
sirius:
  memory:
    host:
      block_size: 64Mi       # default 1Mi: ~5000 copy segments per 5 GB batch
      pool_size: 8           # keep block_size x pool_size at 512Mi per pool
  executor:
    scan_manager:
      memory_prefetcher:     # requires the memory prefetcher (PR #1181)
        enable: true
        num_threads: 3       # 2 is the swept default; 3 buys q21 ~3% under 8 pipeline threads
    pipeline:
      num_threads: 8         # default 4; cliff at 12 (q1/q6 regress)
```

Attribution: host `block_size` 1 Mi → 64 Mi removes per-segment submission
overhead in batched host→GPU copies (~11 ms of every 39 ms five-GB
conversion); sweep 16-64 Mi if small-host-allocation fragmentation is a
concern.  Each uring reactor stages through whole host blocks under a fixed
64 MiB budget, so at `block_size: 64Mi` it pins exactly one block per reactor
and even a small device miss occupies that whole block for the duration of
its I/O. On the REST backend one cache fill is one GET of up to `block_size`,
so data GETs are bounded by a stall detector (`stall_speed_limit_bytes` /
`stall_time_s`) rather than by a whole-transfer deadline: a large block does
not time out on a slow link as long as bytes keep arriving.
`pipeline.num_threads` 4 → 8 helps task-parallel aggregation
queries (q1 -16%, q12 -14%). The prefetcher block overlaps pinned-cache
uploads with compute (see `scan_manager.memory_prefetcher` above). Numbers
include the cuCascade all-valid null-mask conversion fix; without it,
expect roughly half the converter-side gain.

The knobs that did NOT help on this hardware, all measured full-suite:
prefetcher `min_free_fraction` below 0.4, prefetcher threads above 3,
pipeline threads above 8. The H2D interconnect sustains ~350-380 GB/s
regardless of stream count; past these settings the link, not scheduling,
is the bound.
