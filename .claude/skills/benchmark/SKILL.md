# Benchmark Runner

You are running SQL benchmarks for Sirius, a GPU-accelerated SQL query engine built on DuckDB. This skill manages data generation, benchmark execution across two engines (Super Sirius, DuckDB CPU), and result comparison.

Currently this skill covers **TPC-H only**. TPC-DS support has been removed from this skill for now and will be added back later.

## Step 0 — Choose the Benchmark Type (ask first)

Before anything else, ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) which benchmark they want:

- **Regular benchmark**: the per-query timing + GPU-vs-CPU validation runner
  (`performance_test.py`), running the 22 TPC-H queries × N iterations against a parquet or
  `.duckdb` dataset, optionally pinned. Follow **Workflow H-B** and complete "Before Running the
  Regular Benchmark".
- **TPC-H official (power + throughput run)**: the spec-style refresh-function benchmark
  (`tpch_power_throughput.py`) that interleaves the RF1 (insert) and RF2 (delete) refresh
  functions with the query streams and reports Power@Size / Throughput@Size / QphH@Size. Follow
  **Workflow H-C** and complete "Before Running the Official Run".

The "Two Engines", "GPU-Compatible Queries", and "Identifying GPU Fallback and Errors" sections
below apply to both. Do not start either run before completing that path's confirmation gate.

## Two Engines

| Engine | Entry Point | Config | TPC-H Runner |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| **Super Sirius** | `gpu_execution("...")` | **Requires** `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` | `performance_test.py --engine gpu` (or `both`) |
| **DuckDB CPU** | Raw SQL (no GPU wrapping) | Unsets `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` | `performance_test.py --engine cpu` (or `both`) |

**Config file behavior:**
- Super Sirius: `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` must be set and point to a valid file — the script errors if not
- DuckDB CPU: `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` is automatically unset — pure CPU baseline

## Working Directory

All commands run from the **project root**. TPC-H scripts live in `test/tpch_performance/`.

## GPU-Compatible Queries

A query is **GPU-compatible** when it meets both criteria:
1. **Executes completely on Super Sirius** — every operator in the query plan runs on the GPU without falling back to DuckDB's CPU engine
2. **Produces correct results** — the GPU output matches DuckDB CPU output exactly

All 22 TPC-H queries (1-22) are GPU-compatible.

## Identifying GPU Fallback and Errors

When a query cannot run on GPU, Super Sirius produces distinct error messages (see `src/sirius_extension.cpp`):

- `"Error in SiriusGeneratePhysicalPlan: <message>"` — plan generation failed; falls back if `ENABLE_DUCKDB_FALLBACK` is true
- `"Error in SiriusExecuteQuery, fallback to DuckDB"` — plan or execution error with fallback enabled
- `"SiriusExecuteQuery error: <message>"` — thrown when fallback is disabled

Underlying these you'll often see a CUDA / RMM runtime error from the cuDF kernels. These strings are produced by the CUDA runtime, cuDF, RMM, or Thrust and propagate up through the Sirius error wrappers above:

- `"an illegal memory access was encountered"` / `cudaErrorIllegalAddress` — out-of-bounds device pointer, usually a kernel bug or stale buffer
- `"out of memory"` / `"rmm::bad_alloc"` / `"RMM failure"` / `cudaErrorMemoryAllocation` — GPU pool exhausted (often size-driven; try lower `usage_limit_fraction` or pin host-tier)
- `"misaligned address"` / `cudaErrorMisalignedAddress` — alignment bug in a kernel
- `"unspecified launch failure"` / `cudaErrorLaunchFailure` — kernel crashed (often follows an earlier illegal-memory access)
- `"invalid device pointer"` / `cudaErrorInvalidDevicePointer` — host pointer passed where a device pointer was expected
- `"thrust::system_error"` / `"cudaError"` / `"CUDA error:"` — generic catch-all prefixes
- `"Assertion `...` failed"` — cuDF/libcudf assertion (often a precondition violation)

These messages land in the post-split per-query Sirius logs at `<benchmark_dir>/sirius/q<N>/sirius.log`:

```bash
# Queries that fell back to DuckDB CPU
grep -l "fallback to DuckDB" <benchmark_dir>/sirius/q*/sirius.log

# Sirius-level plan / execution errors
grep -l "Error in SiriusGeneratePhysicalPlan" <benchmark_dir>/sirius/q*/sirius.log
grep -l "Error in SiriusExecuteQuery"        <benchmark_dir>/sirius/q*/sirius.log

# CUDA / RMM runtime errors (catches the common categories in one pass)
grep -lE "illegal memory access|out of memory|rmm::bad_alloc|RMM failure|misaligned address|unspecified launch failure|invalid device pointer|thrust::system_error|cudaError|CUDA error:|Assertion .* failed" \
    <benchmark_dir>/sirius/q*/sirius.log
```

A query that **falls back internally** (Sirius fallback enabled — the default) still returns rows to the Python client, so `csv/runtimes.csv` is complete and `<engine>/q<N>/result.txt` is populated; the fallback only shows up in the per-query Sirius log. A query that **errors outright** (fallback disabled, or a non-recoverable CUDA error like illegal memory access) raises a Python exception in `con.execute(...).fetchall()` and aborts the run — `csv/runtimes.csv` is truncated at the failing iteration and the per-query Sirius log captures the underlying error.

**Note on illegal memory access**: once CUDA hits `cudaErrorIllegalAddress`, the device context is poisoned and **every subsequent kernel launch fails** with the same error until the process exits. If you see "illegal memory access" repeating across queries, look at the **first** occurrence — the rest are downstream noise.

# TPC-H Benchmarks

Scripts are in `test/tpch_performance/`.

## TPC-H Tables

8 tables: `customer`, `lineitem`, `nation`, `orders`, `part`, `partsupp`, `region`, `supplier`.

## TPC-H Query Files

- **Sirius and DuckDB runners:** queries are defined in `test/tpch_performance/queries.py`; `performance_test.py` renders the scale-dependent Q11 fraction from `--scale-factor`.
- Plain SQL files at `test/tpch_performance/tpch_queries/orig/q*.sql` are kept for reference but are no longer wired into the recommended Python runner.

## Workflow H-A: Generate TPC-H Data

**Generation gate — ALWAYS ask before generating.** Before generating anything (via `/dataset-manager` or the script below), ask the user whether the dataset already exists and where. A missing path is not proof the dataset doesn't exist — datasets are typically shared across worktrees (e.g. the main checkout's `test_datasets/`, not the current worktree's) or kept elsewhere on disk, so the user may already have it at a location you haven't checked. Generate only after the user explicitly confirms no existing dataset is available.

Data generation is owned by the **`/dataset-manager`** skill — the single source of truth for both formats. Prefer delegating to it rather than calling the script directly. It produces:

- **parquet** → `test_datasets/tpch_parquet_sf<SF>/` (a directory; built via `tpchgen-rs`)
- **duckdb** → `test_datasets/tpch_sf<SF>.duckdb` (a single file; built via DuckDB `dbgen()`), or `tpch_sf<SF>_sorted.duckdb` when generated with `--cluster` (tables physically sorted so native-scan row-group pruning fires on date-filtered queries)

If `/dataset-manager` is unavailable, the underlying script is:

```bash
cd test/tpch_performance
pixi run bash generate_tpch_data.sh <scale_factor> --format parquet|duckdb [--cluster] [--output <path>]
```

`performance_test.py` consumes either source: pass the parquet **directory** with `--data-source parquet` (default) or the `.duckdb` **file** with `--data-source duckdb`.

## Workflow H-B: Python Performance Test (regular per-query runner)

`performance_test.py` runs the 22 TPC-H queries against a parquet **or** duckdb dataset (`--data-source`) for either or both engines, writes per-query timings/results/logs into a structured benchmark directory, and supports pinning tables into the Sirius cache.

```bash
export SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.yaml
pixi run python test/tpch_performance/performance_test.py \
    --input <parquet_dir> --scale-factor <SF> [options]
```

**Required:**
- `--input <path>` — the dataset. A **parquet directory** (with `--data-source parquet`, default) or a single **`.duckdb` file** (with `--data-source duckdb`).
- `--scale-factor <SF>` — the dataset scale used to render Q11 as `0.0001 / SF`. Always pass it explicitly; omission defaults to SF1 with a warning only for rollout compatibility.

**Most-used flags** — the complete reference lives in `test/tpch_performance/CLAUDE.md` and `performance_test.py --help`; consult it rather than re-deriving flags here:
- `--data-source {parquet,duckdb}` (default `parquet`) — input source/format. `parquet`: `--input` is a parquet directory (`read_parquet` scan). `duckdb`: `--input` is a single `.duckdb` file (GPU-native `seq_scan`). Works in all modes; `--pin` works for both.
- `--engine {gpu,cpu,both}` (default `both`) — `gpu`/`both` load the Sirius extension; `cpu` does not.
- `--iterations <N>` (default `1`) and `--queries 1,3,6-10` (default: all 22).
- `--execution {cold,lukewarm,hot}` (optional; omit to change nothing) — the cache state to measure. Each value also sets `cache.mode` / `cache.eviction` in the Sirius config, overriding `--config`. `cold` drops the OS page cache and calls `reset_sirius_cache()` before every run (needs the sudo setup below); `lukewarm` drops the OS cache once then lets caches fill under LRU; `hot` runs iterations back-to-back per query.
- `--precmd none|nsys|gdb` — `none` is the normal in-process benchmark; `nsys` is GPU-only and owned by the `profile-analyzer` skill; `gdb` runs each GPU query under batch-mode GDB. External runners have their own execution model and reject an explicit `--execution`.
- `--pin {none,gpu,host}` (default `none`) — Sirius cache pre-load tier; rejected with `--engine cpu`.
- `--pin-compression` (default off) — Simpatico-compressed pins; requires `--pin gpu|host`. Plan dir via `--compression-plan-dir` (defaults to the shipped `plans/tpch_sf1000`).
- `--validation` — byte-compare GPU vs CPU results after timing (`abs_tol=1e-10` on floats); requires `--engine both`.
- `--name <NAME>` — label the output subdir instead of the default `tpch_<ts>_<mode>_<engine>_iter<N>`.

The CLAUDE.md is the source of truth for the rest of the surface (`--config`, `--output`, `--duckdb-profiling`, `--query-timeout`), the per-query pin column lists in `tpch_pin_columns.py`, and the shell-runner-only `--pinning-mode` path. (Note: `performance_test.py --data-source` is the harness's own 2-value flag, distinct from the legacy shell `benchmark_and_validate.sh --data-source`.)

**Examples:**
```bash
# SF1, hot cache, both engines, 2 iterations (parquet directory)
pixi run python test/tpch_performance/performance_test.py \
    --input ~/sirius/test_datasets/tpch_parquet_sf1 \
    --scale-factor 1 \
    --iterations 2 --engine both

# Validate GPU vs CPU after timing (queries 1/3/6)
pixi run python test/tpch_performance/performance_test.py \
    --input ~/sirius/test_datasets/tpch_parquet_sf1 \
    --scale-factor 1 \
    --engine both --iterations 1 --validation --queries 1,3,6

# DuckDB source (a .duckdb FILE) from disk, both engines, validate
pixi run python test/tpch_performance/performance_test.py \
    --input ~/sirius/test_datasets/tpch_sf1.duckdb --data-source duckdb \
    --scale-factor 1 \
    --engine both --iterations 1 --validation --queries 1,3,6

# DuckDB source pinned into the GPU cache
pixi run python test/tpch_performance/performance_test.py \
    --input ~/sirius/test_datasets/tpch_sf100.duckdb --data-source duckdb \
    --scale-factor 100 \
    --engine gpu --iterations 3 --pin gpu
```

### Data Source: parquet vs duckdb (disk vs pinned)

- **parquet** (`--data-source parquet`, default): `--input` is a **directory** of TPC-H `.parquet` files (`read_parquet` → `GPU_PARQUET_SCAN`).
- **duckdb** (`--data-source duckdb`): `--input` is a single **`.duckdb` file** whose native TPC-H tables are scanned via the GPU-native `seq_scan` → `GPU_DUCKDB_NATIVE_SCAN`. Works with every runner.
- **Disk vs pinned** is controlled by `--pin`, independently of the source:
  - *from disk*: omit `--pin` (or `--pin none`) — data is read from the parquet/`.duckdb` file each scan.
  - *pinned*: `--pin gpu` or `--pin host` pre-loads the referenced columns into the Sirius cache.
- To confirm a pinned run actually hit the cache, grep `<benchmark_dir>/sirius/q<N>/sirius.log` for `using cached_split_provider` (cache hit) vs `not all the columns are pinned for this query` (fell through to disk).

### Cold-Run Benchmarking (`--execution cold`)

`drop_os_cache()` writes `3` to `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` via passwordless `sudo`. Before running `--execution cold`, ask the user to run this one-time setup (do not proceed until the user confirms it is done):

```bash
echo "$(whoami) ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/drop_caches
```

### Output Layout

A timestamped benchmark dir `<output>/tpch_<ts>_<mode>_<engine>_iter<N>/` (or `<output>/<NAME>/`) containing `metadata.json` (including `scale_factor`), effective `queries/q<N>.sql`, `csv/runtimes.csv` (`engine,query,iteration,runtime_s`), per-query `<engine>/q<N>/result.txt`, and per-query `sirius/q<N>/sirius.log`. See `test/tpch_performance/CLAUDE.md` for the full layout.

# TPC-H Official — Power & Throughput Run

## Workflow H-C: `tpch_power_throughput.py`

The official run adds the TPC-H refresh functions (RF1 insert, RF2 delete) to the query workload
and reports the spec composite metrics. Use it whenever the user asks for a power run, throughput
run, QphH, refresh functions, or a "TPC-H official"/"spec" benchmark.

- **Power run** (single stream, update set 1): optional clean pass → RF1 → 22 queries in spec
  stream-0 order (timed; feeds Power@Size) → RF2 → timed post-RF2 pass (delete mask active).
- **Throughput run** (update sets 2..N+1): N concurrent query streams (spec permutations 1..N) +
  one refresh stream running N RF1/RF2 pairs.
- `Power@Size = 3600·SF / geomean(22 query times + T_RF1 + T_RF2)`,
  `Throughput@Size = N·22·3600 / interval · SF`, `QphH@Size = sqrt(Power·Throughput)`.

**Hard requirements:**
- Data source is a file-backed `.duckdb` with native TPC-H tables, never parquet. The MVCC
  insert-delta/delete-mask path that makes RF1/RF2 visible on the GPU only works on pinned
  duckdb-native tables. `--input` is that `.duckdb` file; the runner copies it and mutates the
  copy, never the original.
- Always pinned. The runner pins all 8 tables once up front, each with only the union of the
  columns the 22 queries reference (not whole tables — `ps_comment`/`l_comment`/`o_clerk`/
  `p_comment` are never read, and pinning them does not fit at SF1000). The user only chooses the
  tier (`gpu` or `host`). An unpinned run would not show the refreshes on the GPU.
- Refresh sets come from `generate_tpch_refresh.sh` (classic dbgen `-U`): `orders.tbl.u*`,
  `lineitem.tbl.u*`, `delete.*` under `test_datasets/tpch_refresh_sf<SF>/`. Need at least
  `streams + 1` sets (set 1 = power run; sets 2..N+1 = throughput streams).
- With varied predicates, per-stream query sets come from `generate_tpch_queries.sh` (`qgen`):
  `stream<N>.sql` under `test_datasets/tpch_queries_sf<SF>/`, streams 0..N (0 = power run).

```bash
# One-time per SF: generate refresh sets (num_sets >= streams + 1)
./test/tpch_performance/generate_tpch_refresh.sh <SF> <num_sets>   # -> test_datasets/tpch_refresh_sf<SF>/

# Only for varied predicates: per-stream query sets from qgen (streams 0..N)
./test/tpch_performance/generate_tpch_queries.sh <SF> <streams>    # -> test_datasets/tpch_queries_sf<SF>/

export SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config.yaml
pixi run python test/tpch_performance/tpch_power_throughput.py \
    --sf <SF> --input <base.duckdb> --refresh-dir <refresh_dir> \
    --mode both --pin gpu|host [--streams N] [--vary-predicates --query-dir <dir>]
```

**Flags** (full reference in `test/tpch_performance/CLAUDE.md`): `--mode power|throughput|both`
(default `both`), `--streams N` (default: spec minimum for SF — SF1→2, SF10→3, SF30→4, SF100→5),
`--pin gpu|host` (always one of these), `--pin-compression/--no-pin-compression`
(Simpatico-compressed pins; plan dir defaults to the shipped TPC-H plans),
`--compression-plan-dir <dir>`, `--vary-predicates/--no-vary-predicates` (default fixed;
varied runs per-stream qgen parameters and rejects `--validation`), `--query-dir <dir>`,
`--validation/--no-validation` (fixed predicates only, default on; the power run's post-RF1 and
post-RF2 GPU rows are diffed against pure DuckDB in a child process after every pinned phase
completes, with the refresh functions replayed on a fresh copy — it cannot share the benchmark
process, since the host pool does not return memory to the OS on unpin. In `--mode both` the
throughput streams are validated too: the child re-runs the N throughput RF1/RF2 pairs and
snapshots the CPU results after the baseline and each commit, and every stream's GPU rows must
match one of those 2N+1 snapshots — which committed refresh state a concurrent query observed is
a scheduling accident, but it must be one of them),
`--baseline-pass/--no-baseline-pass`
(default on; adds the clean pre-refresh timing pass so delta/mask overhead is attributable),
`--query-timeout`, `--output`, `--keep-scratch-db`.

**Output** (`test/tpch_performance/output/tpch_power_<ts>_sf<SF>_s<N>/`): `metrics.json`,
`summary.txt` (per-query clean/post-RF1/post-RF2 timings + delta/mask overhead + the three
metrics), `timings.csv`, per-query `power/q<N>/result_*.txt`, `log_dir/`. A **non-zero exit** means
a validation mismatch or an unexpected row-count after a refresh — treat it as a failure.

# Before Running the Regular Benchmark (`performance_test.py`) — ALWAYS Confirm Every Parameter First

**This is mandatory and must not be skipped.** Before invoking `performance_test.py`, you MUST confirm **every** parameter with the user via the `AskUserQuestion` tool — never silently assume defaults, and never skip this gate even when the request looks complete. Pre-fill any value the user already gave (present it as the recommended option) and ask for the rest, so a `/benchmark` run never starts with an unconfirmed configuration.

Ask in ~3 grouped rounds (`AskUserQuestion` allows up to 4 questions per call). Mark sensible defaults as "(Recommended)".

**Round 1 — data & engine**
1. **Data source** (`--data-source`) — `parquet` or `duckdb`.
2. **Dataset** (`--input`) — the parquet **directory** or `.duckdb` **file** path. ALWAYS ask the user where the dataset lives — never assume a path, and never treat a missing path as "needs generating": the dataset may already exist at a different location (see the generation gate in Workflow H-A). If the given path doesn't exist, report that and ask for the correct location; offer generation via `/dataset-manager` only after the user confirms no existing dataset is available (generation can take significant time and disk at large scale factors — **never auto-generate**). For duckdb, clarify plain vs `--cluster` (sorted) if generating.
3. **Scale factor** (`--scale-factor`) — the dataset's scale factor; this must match the input because it controls Q11's threshold.
4. **Config** (`--config` / `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE`) — which Sirius config YAML to use (required for any GPU engine). Do not guess the path; confirm it.
5. **Engine** (`--engine`) — `gpu`, `cpu`, or `both` (default `both`).

**Round 2 — execution shape**
1. **Execution profile** (`--execution`, optional — omitted leaves the config untouched and runs iterations back-to-back) — `hot`, `lukewarm` (OS cache dropped once, LRU retention, round-robin), or `cold` (per-query OS cache drop + `reset_sirius_cache()`; needs the sudo setup below). `--precmd nsys|gdb` selects a separate GPU-only external runner; Nsight is owned by the `profile-analyzer` skill.
2. **Pin** (`--pin`) — `none` (from disk), `gpu`, or `host` (pinned cache tier; rejected with `--engine cpu`). This is how "from disk vs pinned" is chosen, for either source.
3. **Pin compression** (`--pin-compression`) — only ask when Pin is `gpu` or `host`; skip it entirely for `none` (the runner rejects the combination). Off (Recommended) or Simpatico-compressed pins. When compression is chosen, always ask which plan directory to use — the shipped `src/compression/simpatico_codegen/plans/tpch_sf1000` (Recommended) or a user-supplied `--compression-plan-dir` path; never assume the default without confirming it.
4. **Iterations** (`--iterations`) — per-query iteration count (default `1`).
5. **Queries** (`--queries`) — all 22 (default) or a subset like `1,3,6-10`.

**Round 3 — output**
1. **Validation** (`--validation`) — byte-compare GPU vs CPU after timing (requires `--engine both`).
2. **Name** (`--name`) — optional label for the output subdir (e.g. `baseline`, `sf1000-host-pin`); if declined, omit it and let the default `tpch_<ts>_<mode>_<engine>_iter<N>` be used. Do not invent a name unprompted.

After confirming, echo the final `performance_test.py` command back to the user before running it.

**Environment prerequisites** (verify these yourself; they are not user questions):
- Sirius extension built: `pixi run -e clang make release` (the runner loads `build/release/extension/sirius/sirius.duckdb_extension` for any GPU engine).
- For Super Sirius: `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` set, or `--config <yaml>` passed (confirmed in Round 1).

# Before Running the Official Run (`tpch_power_throughput.py`) — ALWAYS Confirm Every Parameter First

**Mandatory — do not skip.** Confirm every parameter with `AskUserQuestion` before invoking
`tpch_power_throughput.py`. Pre-fill anything the user already gave (present it as the recommended
option) and ask for the rest. Mark sensible defaults "(Recommended)".

**Round 1 — data (ask for the paths first; never generate before asking)**
1. **Base dataset** (`--input`): the file-backed `.duckdb` file with native TPC-H tables (parquet
   is not allowed here). Always ask the user where it lives. Never assume a path, and never treat a
   missing path as "must generate" — these datasets are usually shared (e.g. the main checkout's
   `test_datasets/tpch_sf<SF>.duckdb`, not the current worktree's), so one may already exist. Only
   after the user confirms none exists, offer to generate a duckdb dataset via `/dataset-manager`
   (or `generate_tpch_data.sh --format duckdb`); generation is slow and large at scale, so never
   auto-generate.
2. **Refresh data** (`--refresh-dir`): the directory of `orders.tbl.u*` / `lineitem.tbl.u*` /
   `delete.*` sets. Always ask where it lives before generating anything. Only after the user
   confirms it doesn't exist, generate it with `generate_tpch_refresh.sh <SF> <num_sets>` (needs
   `num_sets >= streams + 1`). Confirm the directory holds at least `streams + 1` sets.
3. **Config** (`--config` / `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE`): the Sirius config YAML, required (the runner
   refuses to start without one and has no default path). Always ask the user where the config
   lives. Don't treat an already-set `SIRIUS_CONFIG_FILE` as the answer; present it as the
   recommended option and confirm it.
4. **Scale factor** (`--sf`): the SF of the dataset (also the metric's Size).

**Round 2 — run shape**
1. **Mode** (`--mode`): `power`, `throughput`, or `both` (default `both`). In `both` the
   throughput run continues on the same pinned DB right after the power run, with no unpin/repin.
2. **Predicates** (`--vary-predicates`): fixed for every stream (Recommended; required for
   validation) or varied per stream (each stream's own qgen parameters — what an official run
   requires; validation not supported). Always ask this — it decides whether validation is even
   possible. Varied also needs a `--query-dir` of `stream<N>.sql` files: ask where it lives, and
   only generate with `generate_tpch_queries.sh <SF> <num_streams>` once the user confirms none
   exists.
3. **Pin tier** (`--pin`): `gpu` or `host`. This run is always pinned; the only choice is the
   tier. Prefer `host` at large SF, since pinning all 8 tables to GPU can OOM and disk spill is
   off by default.
4. **Pin compression** (`--pin-compression`): off (Recommended) or Simpatico-compressed pins.
   Compression happens at pin time, so it needs the pinned tier from the previous question. When
   compression is chosen, always ask which plan directory to use — present the shipped
   `src/compression/simpatico_codegen/plans/tpch_sf1000` as the recommended option (covers 6 of
   8 tables) against a user-supplied `--compression-plan-dir` path; never assume the default
   without confirming it.
5. **Streams** (`--streams`): throughput query-stream count (default: TPC-H spec minimum for the
   SF). Ensure the refresh dir has `streams + 1` sets.
6. **Validation** (`--validation`): only ask with fixed predicates (default on there): the
   post-RF1/post-RF2 GPU rows are diffed against pure DuckDB in a child process once the pinned
   phases finish, with the refreshes replayed on a fresh copy. In `--mode both` it also covers
   the throughput streams: the child builds a knowledge base of the 2N+1 refresh states a
   concurrent query could have observed (baseline + each throughput RF1/RF2 commit) and each
   stream's GPU rows must match one of them; `--mode throughput` alone skips this (no power
   baseline). It adds one base-DB copy and an untimed CPU pass (2N+1 passes when the throughput
   streams are covered), but does not compete with the pin for memory. With varied predicates
   skip the question — the runner rejects `--validation` — and tell the user the run is
   timing-only.

`--baseline-pass` (clean pre-refresh pass, default on) and `--query-timeout` can take defaults
unless the user asks otherwise.

After confirming, echo the final command(s), including any `generate_tpch_refresh.sh` call (only
if generation was confirmed), before running.

**Environment prerequisites** (verify yourself; not user questions):
- Sirius extension built (`build/release/extension/sirius/sirius.duckdb_extension`).
- `tpch-dbgen` available for refresh and query generation (`test_datasets/tpch-dbgen/`; both
  scripts auto-unzip and build `dbgen`/`qgen` from `test_datasets/tpch-dbgen.zip` if missing).
